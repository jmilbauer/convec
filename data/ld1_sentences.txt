american civil war

the american civil war also known by other names was a civil war that was fought in the united states from NUM to NUM
as a result of the long-standing controversy over slavery war broke out in april NUM when confederate forces attacked fort sumter in south carolina shortly after us president abraham lincoln was inaugurated 
the nationalists of the union proclaimed loyalty to the us constitution 
they faced secessionists of the confederate states who advocated for states rights to expand slavery 
among the NUM us states in february NUM seven southern slave states individually declared their secession from the us to form the confederate states of america or the south 
the confederacy grew to include eleven slave states 
the confederacy was never diplomatically recognized by the united states government nor was it recognized by any foreign country although the united kingdom and france granted it belligerent status
the states that remained loyal to the us including the border states where slavery was legal were known as the union or the north
the union and confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the south over four years 
the union finally won the war when general robert e lee surrendered to general ulysses s grant at the battle of appomattox court house followed by a series of surrenders by confederate generals throughout the southern states 
four years of intense combat left NUM to NUM people dead more than the number of us military deaths in all other wars combined at least until approximately the vietnam war
much of the souths infrastructure was destroyed especially the transportation systems railroads mills and houses 
the confederacy collapsed slavery was abolished and NUM million slaves were freed 
the reconstruction era NUM overlapped and followed the war with the process of restoring national unity strengthening the national government and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country 
the civil war is the most studied and written about episode in us history 
in the NUM presidential election republicans led by abraham lincoln supported banning slavery in all the us territories 
the southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights and as the first step in a grander republican plan to eventually abolish slavery 
the three pro-union candidates together received an overwhelming NUM majority of the votes cast nationally republican lincolns votes centered in the north democrat stephen a douglas votes were distributed nationally and constitutional unionist john bells votes centered in tennessee kentucky and virginia 
the republican party dominant in the north secured a plurality of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally so lincoln was constitutionally elected president 
he was the first republican party candidate to win the presidency 
however before his inauguration seven slave states with cotton-based economies declared secession and formed the confederacy 
the first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations a total of NUM percent 
the first seven with state legislatures to resolve for secession included split majorities for unionists douglas and bell in georgia with NUM and louisiana with NUM
alabama had voted NUM for those unionists mississippi with NUM florida with NUM texas with NUM and south carolina cast electoral college votes without a popular vote for president 
of these only texas held a referendum on secession 
eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession 
outgoing democratic president james buchanan and the incoming republicans rejected secession as illegal 
lincolns march NUM NUM inaugural address declared that his administration would not initiate a civil war 
speaking directly to the southern states he attempted to calm their fears of any threats to slavery reaffirming i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the united states where it exists 
i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so 
after confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the confederacy efforts at compromise failed and both sides prepared for war 
the confederates assumed that european countries were so dependent on king cotton that they would intervene but none did and none recognized the new confederate states of america 
hostilities began on april NUM NUM when confederate forces fired upon fort sumter 
while in the western theater the union made significant permanent gains in the eastern theater the battle was inconclusive from NUM
later in NUM lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation which made ending slavery a war goal 
to the west by summer NUM the union destroyed the confederate river navy then much of their western armies and seized new orleans 
the NUM union siege of vicksburg split the confederacy in two at the mississippi river 
in NUM robert e lees confederate incursion north ended at the battle of gettysburg 
western successes led to ulysses s grants command of all union armies in NUM
inflicting an ever-tightening naval blockade of confederate ports the union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the confederacy from all directions leading to the fall of atlanta to william t sherman and his march to the sea 
the last significant battles raged around the siege of petersburg 
lees escape attempt ended with his surrender at appomattox court house on april NUM NUM
while the military war was coming to an end the political reintegration of the nation was to take another NUM years known as the reconstruction era 
the american civil war was one of the earliest true industrial wars 
railroads the telegraph steamships and iron-clad ships and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively 
the mobilization of civilian factories mines shipyards banks transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in world war i world war ii and subsequent conflicts 
it remains the deadliest war in american history 
from NUM to NUM it is estimated that NUM to NUM soldiers died along with an undetermined number of civilians 
by one estimate the war claimed the lives of NUM percent of all northern males NUM years old and NUM percent of all southern white males aged NUM
the causes of secession were complex and have been controversial since the war began but most academic scholarsidentifyslavery as a central cause of the war 
james c bradford wrote that the issue has been further complicated by historical revisionists who have tried to offer a variety of reasons for the war 
slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the NUMs 
the republican party was determined to prevent any spread of slavery and many southern leaders had threatened secession if the republican candidate lincoln won the NUM election 
after lincoln won many southern leaders felt that disunion was their only option fearing that the loss of representation would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies 
slavery was a major cause of disunion 
although there were opposing views even in the union states most northern soldiers were largely indifferent on the subject of slavery while confederates fought the war largely to protect a southern society of which slavery was an integral part 
from the anti-slavery perspective the issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with republicanism 
the strategy of the anti-slavery forces was containmentto stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction 
the slave-holding interests in the south denounced this strategy as infringing upon their constitutional rights 
southern whites believed that the emancipation of slaves would destroy the souths economy due to the large amount of capital invested in slaves and fears of integrating the ex-slave black population 
in particular southerners feared a repeat of the horrors of santo domingo in which nearly all white people  including men women children and even many sympathetic to abolition  were killed after the successful slave revolt in haiti 
historian thomas fleming points to the historical phrase a disease in the public mind used by critics of this idea and proposes it contributed to the segregation in the jim crow era following emancipation 
these fears were exacerbated by the recent attempts of john brown to instigate an armed slave rebellion in the south 
slavery was illegal in much of the north having been outlawed in the late NUMth and early NUMth centuries 
it was also fading in the border states and in southern cities but it was expanding in the highly profitable cotton districts of the rural south and southwest 
subsequent writers on the american civil war looked to several factors explaining the geographic divide 
sectionalism refers to the different economies social structure customs and political values of the north and south 
regional tensions came to a head during the war of NUM resulting in the hartford convention which manifested northern dissastisfaction with a foreign trade embargo that affected the industrial north disproportionately the three-fifths compromise dilution of northern power by new states and a succession of southern presidents 
sectionalism increased steadily between NUM and NUM as the north which phased slavery out of existence industrialized urbanized and built prosperous farms while the deep south concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor together with subsistence farming for poor freedmen 
in the NUMs and NUMs the issue of accepting slavery in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries split the nations largest religious denominations the methodist baptist and presbyterian churches into separate northern and southern denominations 
historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial northeast and the agricultural south helped cause the war 
most historians now disagree with the economic determinism of historian charles a 
beard in the NUMs and emphasize that northern and southern economies were largely complementary 
while socially different the sections economically benefited each other 
slave owners preferred low-cost manual labor with no mechanization 
northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while southern planters demanded free trade the democrats in congress controlled by southerners wrote the tariff laws in the NUMs NUMs and NUMs and kept reducing rates so that the NUM rates were the lowest since NUM
the republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the NUM election 
the increases were only enacted in NUM after southerners resigned their seats in congress 
the tariff issue was a northern grievance 
however neo-confederate writers have claimed it as a southern grievance 
in NUM none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the tariff issue 
pamphleteers north and south rarely mentioned the tariff 
the south argued that each state had the right to secedeleave the unionat any time that the constitution was a compact or agreement among the states 
northerners including president buchanan rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the founding fathers who said they were setting up a perpetual union 
historian james mcpherson writes concerning states rights and other non-slavery explanations

between NUM and NUM the united states achieved a vast expansion of territory through purchase negotiation and conquest 
at first the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states 
it was over territories west of the mississippi that the proslavery and antislavery forces collided 
with the conquest of northern mexico west to california in NUM slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps cuba and central america as well 
northern free soil interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory 
the compromise of NUM over california balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the NUMs 
but the states admitted following california were all free minnesota NUM oregon NUM and kansas NUM
in the southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive 
both the south and the north drew the same conclusion the power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself 
by NUM four doctrines had emerged to answer the question of federal control in the territories and they all claimed they were sanctioned by the constitution implicitly or explicitly 
the first of these conservative theories represented by the constitutional union party argued that the missouri compromise apportionment of territory north for free soil and south for slavery should become a constitutional mandate 
the crittenden compromise of NUM was an expression of this view 
the second doctrine of congressional preeminence championed by abraham lincoln and the republican party insisted that the constitution did not bind legislators to a policy of balancethat slavery could be excluded in a territory as it was done in the northwest ordinance of NUM at the discretion of congress thus congress could restrict human bondage but never establish it 
the wilmot proviso announced this position in NUM
senator stephen a douglas proclaimed the doctrine of territorial or popular sovereigntywhich asserted that the settlers in a territory had the same rights as states in the union to establish or disestablish slavery as a purely local matter 
the kansasnebraska act of NUM legislated this doctrine 
in kansas territory years of pro and anti-slavery violence and political conflict erupted the congressional house of representatives voted to admit kansas as a free state in early NUM but its admission in the senate was delayed until january NUM after the NUM elections when southern senators began to leave 
the fourth theory was advocated by mississippi senator jefferson davis one of state sovereignty states rights also known as the calhoun doctrine named after the south carolinian political theorist and statesman john c calhoun 
rejecting the arguments for federal authority or self-government state sovereignty would empower states to promote the expansion of slavery as part of the federal union under the us constitution 
states rights was an ideology formulated and applied as a means of advancing slave state interests through federal authority 
as historian thomas l krannawitter points out the southern demand for federal slave protection represented a demand for an unprecedented expansion of federal power 
these four doctrines comprised the major ideologies presented to the american public on the matters of slavery the territories and the us constitution prior to the NUM presidential election 
nationalism was a powerful force in the early NUMth century with famous spokesmen such as andrew jackson and daniel webster 
while practically all northerners supported the union southerners were split between those loyal to the entire united states called unionists and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the confederacy 
c vann woodward said of the latter group

perceived insults to southern collective honor included the enormous popularity of uncle toms cabin NUM and the actions of abolitionist john brown in trying to incite a slave rebellion in NUM
while the south moved towards a southern nationalism leaders in the north were also becoming more nationally minded and they rejected any notion of splitting the union 
the republican national electoral platform of NUM warned that republicans regarded disunion as treason and would not tolerate it we denounce those threats of disunion .. as denying the vital principles of a free government and as an avowal of contemplated treason which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence 
the south ignored the warnings southerners did not realize how ardently the north would fight to hold the union together 
the election of abraham lincoln in november NUM was the final trigger for secession 
efforts at compromise including the corwin amendment and the crittenden compromise failed 
southern leaders feared that lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction 
the slave states which had already become a minority in the house of representatives were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the senate and electoral college against an increasingly powerful north 
before lincoln took office in march NUM seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the confederacy 
according to lincoln the people had shown that they can be successful in establishing and administering a republic but a third challenge faced the nation maintaining a republic based on the peoples vote against an attempt to overthrow it 
among the ordinances of secession passed by the individual states those of threetexas alabama and virginiaspecifically mentioned the plight of the slaveholding states at the hands of northern abolitionists 
the rest make no mention of the slavery issue and are often brief announcements of the dissolution of ties by the legislatures 
however at least four statessouth carolina mississippi georgia and texasalso passed lengthy and detailed explanations of their causes for secession all of which laid the blame squarely on the movement to abolish slavery and that movements influence over the politics of the northern states 
the southern states believed slaveholding was a constitutional right because of the fugitive slave clause of the constitution 
these states agreed to form a new federal government the confederate states of america on february NUM NUM
they took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing president james buchanan whose term ended on march NUM NUM
buchanan said that the dred scott decision was proof that the south had no reason for secession and that the union was intended to be perpetual but that the power by force of arms to compel a state to remain in the union was not among the enumerated powers granted to congress
one quarter of the us armythe entire garrison in texaswas surrendered in february NUM to state forces by its commanding general david e twiggs who then joined the confederacy 
as southerners resigned their seats in the senate and the house republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by southern senators before the war including the morrill tariff land grant colleges the morrill act a homestead act a transcontinental railroad the pacific railway acts the national banking act and the authorization of united states notes by the legal tender act of NUM
the revenue act of NUM introduced the income tax to help finance the war 
on december NUM NUM the crittenden compromise was proposed to re-establish the missouri compromise line by constitutionally banning slavery in territories to the north of the line while guaranteeing it to the south 
the adoption of this compromise likely would have prevented the secession of every southern state apart from south carolina but lincoln and the republicans rejected it 
it was then proposed to hold a national referendum on the compromise 
the republicans again rejected the idea although a majority of both northerners and southerners would have voted in favor of it 
a pre-war february peace conference of NUM met in washington proposing a solution similar to that of the crittenden compromise it was rejected by congress 
the republicans proposed an alternative compromise to not interfere with slavery where it existed but the south regarded it as insufficient 
nonetheless the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in virginias first secessionist convention on april NUM NUM
on march NUM NUM abraham lincoln was sworn in as president 
in his inaugural address he argued that the constitution was a more perfect union than the earlier articles of confederation and perpetual union that it was a binding contract and called any secession legally void
he had no intent to invade southern states nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed but said that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property 
the government would make no move to recover post offices and if resisted mail delivery would end at state lines 
where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of federal law us marshals and judges would be withdrawn 
no mention was made of bullion lost from us mints in louisiana georgia and north carolina 
he stated that it would be us policy to only collect import duties at its ports there could be no serious injury to the south to justify armed revolution during his administration 
his speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union famously calling on the mystic chords of memory binding the two regions 
the south sent delegations to washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the united states 
lincoln rejected any negotiations with confederate agents because he claimed the confederacy was not a legitimate government and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government 
secretary of state william seward who at the time saw himself as the real governor or prime minister behind the throne of the inexperienced lincoln engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed 
president lincoln was determined to hold all remaining union-occupied forts in the confederacy fort monroe in virginia in florida fort pickens fort jefferson fort taylor and fort sumter located at the cockpit of secession in charleston south carolina 
fort sumter was located in the middle of the harbor of charleston south carolina 
its garrison recently moved there to avoid incidents with local militias in the streets of the city 
lincoln told maj anderson to hold on until fired upon 
jefferson davis ordered the surrender of the fort 
anderson gave a conditional reply that the confederate government rejected and davis ordered general p g t beauregard to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive 
he bombarded fort sumter on april NUM forcing its capitulation 
the attack on fort sumter rallied the north to the defense of american nationalism 
historian allan nevins said

union leaders incorrectly assumed that only a minority of southerners were actually in favor of secession and that there were large numbers of southern unionists that could be counted on 
had northerners realized that most southerners really did favor secession they might have hesitated at attempting the enormous task of conquering a united south 
lincoln called on all the states to send forces to recapture the fort and other federal properties 
with the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far lincoln called for only NUM volunteers for NUMdays 
the governor of massachusetts had state regiments on trains headed south the next day 
in western missouri local secessionists seized liberty arsenal 
on may NUM NUM lincoln called for an additional NUM volunteers for a period of three years 
four states in the middle and upper south had repeatedly rejected confederate overtures but now virginia tennessee arkansas and north carolina refused to send forces against their neighbors declared their secession and joined the confederacy 
to reward virginia the confederate capital was moved to richmond 
maryland delaware missouri and kentucky were slave states that were opposed to both secession and coercing the south 
west virginia then joined them as an additional border state after it separated from virginia and became a state of the union in NUM
marylands territory surrounded the united states capital of washington dc and could cut it off from the north 
it had numerous anti-lincoln officials who tolerated anti-army rioting in baltimore and the burning of bridges both aimed at hindering the passage of troops to the south 
marylands legislature voted overwhelmingly NUM to stay in the union but also rejected hostilities with its southern neighbors voting to close marylands rail lines to prevent them from being used for war 
lincoln responded by establishing martial law and unilaterally suspending habeas corpus in maryland along with sending in militia units from the north 
lincoln rapidly took control of maryland and the district of columbia by seizing many prominent figures including arresting NUM of the members of the maryland general assembly on the day it reconvened 
all were held without trial ignoring a ruling by the chief justice of the us supreme court roger taney a maryland native that only congress and not the president could suspend habeas corpus ex parte merryman
indeed federal troops imprisoned a prominent baltimore newspaper editor frank key howard francis scott keys grandson after he criticized lincoln in an editorial for ignoring the supreme court chief justices ruling 
in missouri an elected convention on secession voted decisively to remain within the union 
when pro-confederate governor claiborne f jackson called out the state militia it was attacked by federal forces under general nathaniel lyon who chased the governor and the rest of the state guard to the southwestern corner of the state see also missouri secession
in the resulting vacuum the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the unionist provisional government of missouri 
kentucky did not secede for a time it declared itself neutral 
when confederate forces entered the state in september NUM neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its union status while trying to maintain slavery 
during a brief invasion by confederate forces confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention inaugurated a governor and gained recognition from the confederacy 
the rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled kentucky 
after virginias secession a unionist government in wheeling asked NUM counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on october NUM NUM
a voter turnout of NUM percent approved the statehood bill NUM percent approving
the inclusion of NUM secessionist counties in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war engaged about NUM federal troops for much of the war 
congress admitted west virginia to the union on june NUM NUM
west virginia provided about NUM soldiers to both the confederacy and the union 
a unionist secession attempt occurred in east tennessee but was suppressed by the confederacy which arrested over NUM men suspected of being loyal to the union 
they were held without trial 
the civil war was a contest marked by the ferocity and frequency of battle 
over four years NUM named battles were fought as were many more minor actions and skirmishes which were often characterized by their bitter intensity and high casualties 
in his book the american civil war john keegan writes that the american civil war was to prove one of the most ferocious wars ever fought
without geographic objectives the only target for each side was the enemys soldier 
as the first seven states began organizing a confederacy in montgomery the entire us army numbered NUM
however northern governors had begun to mobilize their militias 
the confederate congress authorized the new nation up to NUM troops sent by governors as early as february 
by may jefferson davis was pushing for NUM men under arms for one year or the duration and that was answered in kind by the us congress 
in the first year of the war both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip 
after the initial enthusiasm faded reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough 
both sides used a draft lawconscriptionas a device to encourage or force volunteering relatively few were actually drafted and served 
the confederacy passed a draft law in april NUM for young men aged NUM to NUM overseers of slaves government officials and clergymen were exempt 
the us congress followed in july authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers 
european immigrants joined the union army in large numbers including NUM born in germany and NUM born in ireland 
when the emancipation proclamation went into effect in january NUM ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states and used to meet the state quotas 
states and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers 
congress tightened the law in march NUM
men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or until mid-NUM pay commutation money 
many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted 
families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home 
there was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft especially in catholic areas 
the great draft riot in new york city in july NUM involved irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the vote of the citys democratic political machine not realizing it made them liable for the draft 
of the NUM men procured for the union through the draft NUM were substitutes leaving only NUM who had their personal services conscripted 
in both the north and south the draft laws were highly unpopular 
in the north some NUM men evaded conscription many of them fleeing to canada and another NUM soldiers deserted during the war 
at least NUM southerners deserted or about NUM percent 
in the south many men deserted temporarily to take care of their distressed families then returned to their units 
in the north bounty jumpers enlisted to get the generous bonus deserted then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name to sign up again for a second bonus NUM were caught and executed 
from a tiny frontier force in NUM the union and confederate armies had grown into the largest and most efficient armies in the world within a few years 
european observers at the time dismissed them as amateur and unprofessional but british historian john keegans assessment is that each outmatched the french prussian and russian armies of the time and but for the atlantic would have threatened any of them with defeat 
perman and taylor NUM say that historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight suffer and die over four years

at the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated 
captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged 
meanwhile they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties 
the system of exchanges collapsed in NUM when the confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners 
after that about NUM of the NUM pows died in prisons during the war accounting for nearly NUM percent of the conflicts fatalities 
the small us navy of NUM was rapidly enlarged to NUM officers and NUM men in NUM with NUM vessels having a tonnage of NUM
its mission was to blockade confederate ports take control of the river system defend against confederate raiders on the high seas and be ready for a possible war with the british royal navy 
meanwhile the main riverine war was fought in the west where a series of major rivers gave access to the confederate heartland if the us navy could take control 
in the east the navy supplied and moved army forces about and occasionally shelled confederate installations 
by early NUM general winfield scott had devised the anaconda plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible 
scott argued that a union blockade of the main ports would weaken the confederate economy 
lincoln adopted parts of the plan but he overruled scotts caution about NUM-day volunteers 
public opinion however demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture richmond 
in april NUM lincoln announced the union blockade of all southern ports commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended 
the south blundered in embargoing cotton exports in NUM before the blockade was effective by the time they realized the mistake it was too late 
king cotton was dead as the south could export less than NUM percent of its cotton 
the blockade shut down the ten confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton especially new orleans mobile and charleston 
by june NUM warships were stationed off the principal southern ports and a year later nearly NUM ships were in service 
the civil war occurred during the early stages of the industrial revolution and subsequently many naval innovations emerged during this time most notably the advent of the ironclad warship 
it began when the confederacy knowing they had to meet or match the unions naval superiority responded to the union blockade by building or converting more than NUM vessels including twenty-six ironclads and floating batteries 
only half of these saw active service 
many were equipped with ram bows creating ram fever among union squadrons wherever they threatened 
but in the face of overwhelming union superiority and the unions own ironclad warships they were unsuccessful 
the confederacy experimented with a submarine which did not work well and with building an ironclad ship the css virginia which was based on rebuilding a sunken union ship the merrimack
on its first foray on march NUM NUM the virginia inflicted significant damage to the unions wooden fleet but the next day the first union ironclad the uss monitor arrived to challenge it in the chesapeake bay 
the resulting three hour battle between the ironclads was a draw but it marked the worldwide transition to ironclad warships 
not long after the battle the confederacy was forced to scuttle the virginia to prevent its capture while the union built many copies of the monitor
lacking the technology and infrastructure to build effective warships the confederacy attempted to obtain warships from britain 
british investors built small fast steam-driven blockade runners that traded arms and luxuries brought in from britain through bermuda cuba and the bahamas in return for high-priced cotton 
many of the ships were designed for speed and were so small that only a small amount of cotton went out 
when the union navy seized a blockade runner the ship and cargo were condemned as a prize of war and sold with the proceeds given to the navy sailors the captured crewmen were mostly british and they were simply released 
the southern economy nearly collapsed during the war 
there were multiple reasons for this the severe deterioration of food supplies especially in cities the failure of southern railroads the loss of control of the main rivers foraging by northern armies and the seizure of animals and crops by confederate armies 
most historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the confederate economy however wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow lee to continue fighting for additional months thanks to fresh supplies of NUM rifles lead blankets and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply 
surdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the southern economy at the cost of few lives in combat 
practically the entire confederate cotton crop was useless although it was sold to union traders costing the confederacy its main source of income 
critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well 
the measure of the blockades success was not the few ships that slipped through but the thousands that never tried it 
merchant ships owned in europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade they simply stopped calling at confederate ports 
to fight an offensive war the confederacy purchased ships from britain converted them to warships and raided american merchant ships in the atlantic and pacific oceans 
insurance rates skyrocketed and the american flag virtually disappeared from international waters 
however the same ships were reflagged with european flags and continued unmolested 
after the war the us demanded that britain pay for the damage done and britain paid the us NUM million in NUM
the NUM union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes


ulysses grant used river transport and andrew footes gunboats of the western flotilla to threaten the confederacys gibraltar of the west at columbus kentucky 
though rebuffed at belmont grant cut off columbus 
the confederates lacking their own gunboats were forced to retreat and the union took control of western kentucky in march NUM
in addition to ocean-going warships coming up the mississippi the union navy used timberclads tinclads and armored gunboats 
shipyards at cairo illinois and st louis built new boats or modified steamboats for action 
they took control of the red tennessee cumberland mississippi and ohio rivers after victories at fort henry february NUM NUM and fort donelson february NUM to NUM NUM and supplied grants forces as he moved into tennessee 
at shiloh pittsburg landing in tennessee in april NUM the confederates made a surprise attack that pushed union forces against the river as night fell 
overnight the navy landed additional reinforcements and grant counter-attacked 
grant and the union won a decisive victorythe first battle with the high casualty rates that would repeat over and over 
memphis fell to union forces on june NUM NUM and became a key base for further advances south along the mississippi river 
on april NUM NUM us 
naval forces under farragut ran past confederate defenses south of new orleans 
confederate forces abandoned the city giving the union a critical anchor in the deep south 
naval forces assisted grant in the long complex vicksburg campaign that resulted in the confederates surrendering at vicksburg mississippi in july NUM and in the union fully controlling the mississippi river soon after 
in one of the first highly visible battles a march by union troops under the command of maj gen irvin mcdowell on the confederate forces near washington was repulsed 
maj gen george b mcclellan took command of the union army of the potomac on july NUM he was briefly general-in-chief of all the union armies but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of maj gen henry w halleck and the war began in earnest in NUM
upon the strong urging of president lincoln to begin offensive operations mcclellan attacked virginia in the spring of NUM by way of the peninsula between the york river and james river southeast of richmond 
although mcclellans army reached the gates of richmond in the peninsula campaign johnston halted his advance at the battle of seven pines then general robert e lee and top subordinates james longstreet and stonewall jackson defeated mcclellan in the seven days battles and forced his retreat 
the northern virginia campaign which included the second battle of bull run ended in yet another victory for the south 
mcclellan resisted general-in-chief hallecks orders to send reinforcements to john popes union army of virginia which made it easier for lees confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops 
emboldened by second bull run the confederacy made its first invasion of the north 
general lee led NUM men of the army of northern virginia across the potomac river into maryland on september NUM
lincoln then restored popes troops to mcclellan 
mcclellan and lee fought at the battle of antietam near sharpsburg maryland on september NUM NUM the bloodiest single day in united states military history 
lees army checked at last returned to virginia before mcclellan could destroy it 
antietam is considered a union victory because it halted lees invasion of the north and provided an opportunity for lincoln to announce his emancipation proclamation 
when the cautious mcclellan failed to follow up on antietam he was replaced by maj gen ambrose burnside 
burnside was soon defeated at the battle of fredericksburg on december NUM NUM when more than NUM union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against maryes heights 
after the battle burnside was replaced by maj gen joseph hooker 
hooker too proved unable to defeat lees army despite outnumbering the confederates by more than two to one he was humiliated in the battle of chancellorsville in may NUM
gen stonewall jackson was shot in the arm by accidental friendly fire during the battle and subsequently died of complications 
gen hooker was replaced by maj gen george meade during lees second invasion of the north in june 
meade defeated lee at the battle of gettysburg july NUM to NUM NUM
this was the bloodiest battle of the war and has been called the wars turning point 
picketts charge on july NUM is often considered the high-water mark of the confederacy because it signaled the collapse of serious confederate threats of victory 
lees army suffered NUM casualties versus meades NUM
however lincoln was angry that meade failed to intercept lees retreat and after meades inconclusive fall campaign lincoln turned to the western theater for new leadership 
at the same time the confederate stronghold of vicksburg surrendered giving the union control of the mississippi river permanently isolating the western confederacy and producing the new leader lincoln needed ulysses s grant 
while the confederate forces had numerous successes in the eastern theater they were defeated many times in the west 
they were driven from missouri early in the war as a result of the battle of pea ridge 
leonidas polks invasion of columbus kentucky ended kentuckys policy of neutrality and turned that state against the confederacy 
nashville and central tennessee fell to the union early in NUM leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization 
the mississippi was opened to union traffic to the southern border of tennessee with the taking of island no 
NUM and new madrid missouri and then memphis tennessee 
in april NUM the union navy captured new orleans which allowed union forces to begin moving up the mississippi 
only the fortress city of vicksburg mississippi prevented union control of the entire river 
general braxton braggs second confederate invasion of kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over maj gen don carlos buell at the battle of perryville although bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the confederacy in that state 
bragg was narrowly defeated by maj gen william rosecrans at the battle of stones river in tennessee 
the one clear confederate victory in the west was the battle of chickamauga 
bragg reinforced by lt gen james longstreets corps from lees army in the east defeated rosecrans despite the heroic defensive stand of maj gen george henry thomas 
rosecrans retreated to chattanooga which bragg then besieged 
the unions key strategist and tactician in the west was ulysses s grant who won victories at forts henry and donelson by which the union seized control of the tennessee and cumberland rivers the battle of shiloh and the battle of vicksburg which cemented union control of the mississippi river and is considered one of the turning points of the war 
grant marched to the relief of rosecrans and defeated bragg at the third battle of chattanooga driving confederate forces out of tennessee and opening a route to atlanta and the heart of the confederacy 
extensive guerrilla warfare characterized the trans-mississippi region as the confederacy lacked the troops and the logistics to support regular armies that could challenge union control 
roving confederate bands such as quantrills raiders terrorized the countryside striking both military installations and civilian settlements 
the sons of liberty and order of the american knights attacked pro-union people elected officeholders and unarmed uniformed soldiers 
these partisans could not be entirely driven out of the state of missouri until an entire regular union infantry division was engaged 
by NUM these violent activities harmed the nationwide anti-war movement organizing against the re-election of lincoln 
missouri not only stayed in the union lincoln took NUM percent of the vote for re-election 
numerous small-scale military actions south and west of missouri sought to control indian territory and new mexico territory for the union 
the union repulsed confederate incursions into new mexico in NUM and the exiled arizona government withdrew into texas 
in the indian territory civil war broke out within tribes 
about NUM indian warriors fought for the confederacy and smaller numbers for the union 
the most prominent cherokee was brigadier general stand watie the last confederate general to surrender 
after the fall of vicksburg in july NUM general kirby smith in texas was informed by jefferson davis that he could expect no further help from east of the mississippi river 
although he lacked resources to beat union armies he built up a formidable arsenal at tyler along with his own kirby smithdom economy a virtual independent fiefdom in texas including railroad construction and international smuggling 
the union in turn did not directly engage him 
its NUM red river campaign to take shreveport louisiana was a failure and texas remained in confederate hands throughout the war 
at the beginning of NUM lincoln made grant commander of all union armies 
grant made his headquarters with the army of the potomac and put maj gen william tecumseh sherman in command of most of the western armies 
grant understood the concept of total war and believed along with lincoln and sherman that only the utter defeat of confederate forces and their economic base would end the war 
this was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes farms and railroads that grant said would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion 
this policy i believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end 
grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire confederacy from multiple directions 
generals george meade and benjamin butler were ordered to move against lee near richmond general franz sigel and later philip sheridan were to attack the shenandoah valley general sherman was to capture atlanta and march to the sea the atlantic ocean generals george crook and william w averell were to operate against railroad supply lines in west virginia and maj gen nathaniel p banks was to capture mobile alabama 
grants army set out on the overland campaign with the goal of drawing lee into a defense of richmond where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the confederate army 
the union army first attempted to maneuver past lee and fought several battles notably at the wilderness spotsylvania and cold harbor 
these battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides and forced lees confederates to fall back repeatedly 
an attempt to outflank lee from the south failed under butler who was trapped inside the bermuda hundred river bend 
each battle resulted in setbacks for the union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals though unlike those prior generals grant fought on rather than retreat 
grant was tenacious and kept pressing lees army of northern virginia back to richmond 
while lee was preparing for an attack on richmond grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the james river and began the protracted siege of petersburg where the two armies engaged in trench warfare for over nine months 
grant finally found a commander general philip sheridan aggressive enough to prevail in the valley campaigns of NUM
sheridan was initially repelled at the battle of new market by former us vice president and confederate gen john c breckinridge 
the battle of new market was the confederacys last major victory of the war 
after redoubling his efforts sheridan defeated maj gen jubal a 
early in a series of battles including a final decisive defeat at the battle of cedar creek 
sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the shenandoah valley a strategy similar to the tactics sherman later employed in georgia 
meanwhile sherman maneuvered from chattanooga to atlanta defeating confederate generals joseph e johnston and john bell hood along the way 
the fall of atlanta on september NUM NUM guaranteed the reelection of lincoln as president 
hood left the atlanta area to swing around and menace shermans supply lines and invade tennessee in the franklin-nashville campaign 
union maj gen john schofield defeated hood at the battle of franklin and george h thomas dealt hood a massive defeat at the battle of nashville effectively destroying hoods army 
leaving atlanta and his base of supplies shermans army marched with an unknown destination laying waste to about NUM percent of the farms in georgia in his march to the sea
he reached the atlantic ocean at savannah georgia in december NUM
shermans army was followed by thousands of freed slaves there were no major battles along the march 
sherman turned north through south carolina and north carolina to approach the confederate virginia lines from the south increasing the pressure on lees army 
lees army thinned by desertion and casualties was now much smaller than grants 
one last confederate attempt to break the union hold on petersburg failed at the decisive battle of five forks sometimes called the waterloo of the confederacy on april NUM
this meant that the union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding richmond-petersburg completely cutting it off from the confederacy 
realizing that the capital was now lost lee decided to evacuate his army 
the confederate capital fell to the union xxv corps composed of black troops 
the remaining confederate units fled west after a defeat at saylers creek 
initially lee did not intend to surrender but planned to regroup at the village of appomattox court house where supplies were to be waiting and then continue the war 
grant chased lee and got in front of him so that when lees army reached appomattox court house they were surrounded 
after an initial battle lee decided that the fight was now hopeless and surrendered his army of northern virginia on april NUM NUM at the mclean house 
in an untraditional gesture and as a sign of grants respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring confederate states to the union lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse traveller 
on april NUM NUM president lincoln was shot by john wilkes booth a southern sympathizer 
lincoln died early the next morning and andrew johnson became the president 
meanwhile confederate forces across the south surrendered as news of lees surrender reached them 
on april NUM NUM general joseph e johnston surrendered nearly NUM men of the army of tennessee to major general william t sherman at the bennett place near present-day durham north carolina 
it proved to be the largest surrender of confederate forces effectively bringing the war to an end 
president johnson officially declared a virtual end to the insurrection on may NUM NUM president jefferson davis was captured the following day 
on june NUM kirby smith officially surrendered his troops in the trans-mississippi department 
on june NUM cherokee leader stand watie became the last confederate general to surrender his forces 
though the confederacy hoped that britain and france would join them against the union this was never likely and so they instead tried to bring britain and france in as mediators 
the union under lincoln and secretary of state william h seward worked to block this and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the confederate states of america 
in NUM southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments hoping to start an economic depression in europe that would force britain to enter the war to get cotton but this did not work 
worse europe developed other cotton suppliers which they found superior hindering the souths recovery after the war 
cotton diplomacy proved a failure as europe had a surplus of cotton while the NUM crop failures in europe made the norths grain exports of critical importance 
it also helped to turn european opinion further away from the confederacy 
it was said that king corn was more powerful than king cotton as us grain went from a quarter of the british import trade to almost half 
when britain did face a cotton shortage it was temporary being replaced by increased cultivation in egypt and india 
meanwhile the war created employment for arms makers ironworkers and british ships to transport weapons 
lincolns foreign policy was deficient in NUM in terms of appealing to european public opinion 
diplomats had to explain that united states was not committed to the ending of slavery but instead they repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession 
confederate spokesmen on the other hand were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty their commitment to free trade and the essential role of cotton in the european economy 
in addition the european aristocracy the dominant factor in every major country was absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the american debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed 
european government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant american republic 
us minister to britain charles francis adams proved particularly adept and convinced britain not to boldly challenge the blockade 
the confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in britain css alabama css shenandoah css tennessee css tallahassee css florida and some others
the most famous the css alabama did considerable damage and led to serious postwar disputes 
however public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in britain where the antislavery movement was powerful 
war loomed in late NUM between the us and britain over the trent affair involving the us navys boarding of the british ship trent and seizure of two confederate diplomats 
however london and washington were able to smooth over the problem after lincoln released the two 
in NUM the british considered mediation between north and south though even such an offer would have risked war with the us british prime minister lord palmerston reportedly read uncle toms cabin three times when deciding on this 
the union victory in the battle of antietam caused them to delay this decision 
the emancipation proclamation over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the confederacy 
despite sympathy for the confederacy frances own seizure of mexico ultimately deterred them from war with the union 
confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by london or paris 
after NUM the polish revolt against russia further distracted the european powers and ensured that they would remain neutral 
the causes of the war the reasons for its outcome and even the name of the war itself are subjects of lingering contention today 
the north and west grew rich while the once-rich south became poor for a century 
the national political power of the slaveowners and rich southerners ended 
historians are less sure about the results of the postwar reconstruction especially regarding the second class citizenship of the freedmen and their poverty 
historians have debated whether the confederacy could have won the war 
most scholars including james mcpherson argue that confederate victory was at least possible 
mcpherson argues that the norths advantage in population and resources made northern victory likely but not guaranteed 
he also argues that if the confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the union 
confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the north that the cost of winning was too high 
the north needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat confederate armies to win 
lincoln was not a military dictator and could continue to fight the war only as long as the american public supported a continuation of the war 
the confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting lincoln however after atlanta fell and lincoln defeated mcclellan in the election of NUM all hope for a political victory for the south ended 
at that point lincoln had secured the support of the republicans war democrats the border states emancipated slaves and the neutrality of britain and france 
by defeating the democrats and mcclellan he also defeated the copperheads and their peace platform 
many scholars argue that the union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the confederacy in industrial strength and population 
confederate actions they argue only delayed defeat 
civil war historian shelby foote expressed this view succinctly i think that the north fought that war with one hand behind its back .
if there had been more southern victories and a lot more the north simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back 
i dont think the south ever had a chance to win that war 
a minority view among historians is that the confederacy lost because as e merton coulter put it people did not will hard enough and long enough to win 
marxist historian armstead robinson agrees pointing to a class conflict in the confederate army between the slave owners and the larger number of non-owners 
he argues that the non-owner soldiers grew embittered about fighting to preserve slavery and fought less enthusiastically 
he attributes the major confederate defeats in NUM at vicksburg and missionary ridge to this class conflict 
however most historians reject the argument 
james m mcpherson after reading thousands of letters written by confederate soldiers found strong patriotism that continued to the end they truly believed they were fighting for freedom and liberty 
even as the confederacy was visibly collapsing in NUM he says most confederate soldiers were fighting hard 
historian gary gallagher cites general sherman who in early NUM commented the devils seem to have a determination that cannot but be admired 
despite their loss of slaves and wealth with starvation looming sherman continued yet i see no sign of let upsome few desertersplenty tired of war but the masses determined to fight it out 
also important were lincolns eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the union cause 
the emancipation proclamation was an effective use of the presidents war powers 
the confederate government failed in its attempt to get europe involved in the war militarily particularly britain and france 
southern leaders needed to get european powers to help break up the blockade the union had created around the southern ports and cities 
lincolns naval blockade was NUM percent effective at stopping trade goods as a result imports and exports to the south declined significantly 
the abundance of european cotton and britains hostility to the institution of slavery along with lincolns atlantic and gulf of mexico naval blockades severely decreased any chance that either britain or france would enter the war 
historian don doyle has argued that the union victory had a major impact on the course of world history 
the union victory energized popular democratic forces 
a confederate victory on the other hand would have meant a new birth of slavery not freedom 
historian fergus bordewich following doyle argues that

scholars have debated what the effects of the war were on political and economic power in the south 
the prevailing view is that the southern planter elite retained its powerful position in the south 
however a NUM study challenges this noting that while some southern elites retained their economic status the turmoil of the NUMs created greater opportunities for economic mobility in the south than in the north 
the war resulted in at least NUM casualties NUM percent of the population including about NUM soldier deathstwo-thirds by disease and NUM civilians 
binghamton university historian j david hacker believes the number of soldier deaths was approximately NUM NUM percent higher than traditionally estimated and possibly as high as NUM
the war accounted for more american deaths than in all other us wars combined 
based on NUM census figures NUM percent of all white males aged NUM to NUM died in the war including NUM percent in the north and NUM percent in the south 
about NUM soldiers died in prison camps during the war 
an estimated NUM men lost limbs in the war 
union army dead amounting to NUM percent of the over two million who served was broken down as follows

in addition there were NUM deaths in the navy NUM in battle and NUM in the marines NUM in battle
black troops made up NUM percent of the union death toll they amounted to NUM percent of disease deaths but less than NUM percent of those killed in battle 
losses among african americans were high in the last year and a half and from all reported casualties approximately NUM percent of all african americans enrolled in the military lost their lives during the civil war 
notably their mortality rate was significantly higher than white soldiers
confederate records compiled by historian william f fox list NUM killed and died of wounds and NUM died of disease 
including confederate estimates of battle losses where no records exist would bring the confederate death toll to NUM killed and died of wounds 
fox complained however that records were incomplete especially during the last year of the war and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds
thomas l livermore using foxs data put the number of confederate non-combat deaths at NUM using the official estimate of union deaths from disease and accidents and a comparison of union and confederate enlistment records for a total of NUM deaths 
however this excludes the NUM deaths of confederate troops in prisons which would raise the minimum number of deaths to NUM
the united states national park service uses the following figures in its official tally of war losses

union NUM

confederate NUM

while the figures of NUM army deaths for the union and NUM for the confederacy remained commonly cited they are incomplete 
in addition to many confederate records being missing partly as a result of confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits both armies only counted troops who died during their service and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged 
this often happened only a few days or weeks later 
francis amasa walker superintendent of the NUM census used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of NUM union military deaths and NUM confederate military deaths for a total death toll of NUM soldiers 
while walkers estimates were originally dismissed because of the NUM censuss undercounting it was later found that the census was only off by NUM.NUM and that the data walker used would be roughly accurate 
analyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least NUM and at most NUM but most likely NUM soldiers died in the war 
this would break down to approximately NUM confederate and NUM union military deaths going by the proportion of union to confederate battle losses 
deaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate due to the lack of reliable census data at the time though they were known to be considerable as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the union army did not have sufficient shelter doctors or food for them 
university of connecticut professor james downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease starvation exposure or execution at the hands of the confederates and that if these deaths are counted in the wars total the death toll would exceed NUM million 
losses were far higher than during the recent defeat of mexico which saw roughly thirteen thousand american deaths including fewer than two thousand killed in battle between NUM and NUM
one reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the napoleonic wars at the turn of the century such as charging 
with the advent of more accurate rifled barrels mini balls and near the end of the war for the union army repeating firearms such as the spencer repeating rifle and the henry repeating rifle soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open 
this led to the adoption of trench warfare a style of fighting that defined much of world war i 
the wealth amassed in slaves and slavery for the confederacys NUM.NUM million blacks effectively ended when union armies arrived they were nearly all freed by the emancipation proclamation 
slaves in the border states and those located in some former confederate territory occupied before the emancipation proclamation were freed by state action or on december NUM NUM by the thirteenth amendment 
the war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the south 
all accumulated investment confederate bonds was forfeit most banks and railroads were bankrupt 
income per person in the south dropped to less than NUM percent of that of the north a condition that lasted until well into the NUMth century 
southern influence in the us federal government previously considerable was greatly diminished until the latter half of the NUMth century 
the full restoration of the union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as reconstruction 
while not all southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in lees army had close family ties to slavery 
to northerners in contrast the motivation was primarily to preserve the union not to abolish slavery 
abraham lincoln consistently made preserving the union the central goal of the war though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal 
lincolns decision to issue the emancipation proclamation angered both peace democrats copperheads and war democrats but energized most republicans 
by warning that free blacks would flood the north democrats made gains in the NUM elections but they did not gain control of congress 
the republicans counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support with the democrats losing decisively in the NUM elections in the northern state of ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment 
the emancipation proclamation enabled african-americans both free blacks and escaped slaves to join the union army 
about NUM volunteered further enhancing the numerical advantage the union armies enjoyed over the confederates who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery 
during the civil war sentiment concerning slaves enslavement and emancipation in the united states was divided 
in NUM lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states and that to lose kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game 
copperheads and some war democrats opposed emancipation although the latter eventually accepted it as part of total war needed to save the union 
at first lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by secretary of war simon cameron and generals john c frmont in missouri and david hunter in south carolina georgia and florida to keep the loyalty of the border states and the war democrats 
lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected 
but only the district of columbia accepted lincolns gradual plan which was enacted by congress 
when lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation seward advised lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it as to do otherwise would seem like our last shriek on the retreat
lincoln laid the groundwork for public support in an open letter published in abolitionist horace greeleys newspaper 
in september NUM the battle of antietam provided this opportunity and the subsequent war governors conference added support for the proclamation 
lincoln issued his preliminary emancipation proclamation on september NUM NUM and his final emancipation proclamation on january NUM NUM
in his letter to albert g hodges lincoln explained his belief that if slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong .. and yet i have never understood that the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling .
i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me 
lincolns moderate approach succeeded in inducing border states war democrats and emancipated slaves to fight for the union 
the union-controlled border states kentucky missouri maryland delaware and west virginia and union-controlled regions around new orleans norfolk and elsewhere were not covered by the emancipation proclamation 
all abolished slavery on their own except kentucky and delaware 
since the emancipation proclamation was based on the presidents war powers it only included territory held by confederates at the time 
however the proclamation became a symbol of the unions growing commitment to add emancipation to the unions definition of liberty 
the emancipation proclamation greatly reduced the confederacys hope of getting aid from britain or france 
by late NUM lincoln was playing a leading role in getting congress to vote for the thirteenth amendment which made emancipation universal and permanent 
in texas v white the united states supreme court ruled that texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the union despite claims that it joined the confederate states the court further held that the constitution did not permit states to unilaterally secede from the united states and that the ordinances of secession and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances were absolutely null under the constitution 
reconstruction began during the war with the emancipation proclamation of january NUM NUM and it continued until NUM
it comprised multiple complex methods to resolve the outstanding issues of the wars aftermath the most important of which were the three reconstruction amendments to the constitution which remain in effect to the present time the NUMth NUM the NUMth NUM and the NUMth NUM
from the union perspective the goals of reconstruction were to consolidate the union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the union to guarantee a republican form of government for the ex-confederate states and to permanently end slaveryand prevent semi-slavery status 
president johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in NUM when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the thirteenth amendment 
radical republicans demanded proof that confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free 
they came to the fore after the NUM elections and undid much of johnsons work 
in NUM the liberal republicans argued that the war goals had been achieved and that reconstruction should end 
they ran a presidential ticket in NUM but were decisively defeated 
in NUM democrats primarily southern took control of congress and opposed any more reconstruction 
the compromise of NUM closed with a national consensus that the civil war had finally ended 
with the withdrawal of federal troops however whites retook control of every southern legislature the jim crow period of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was about to begin 
the civil war is one of the central events in american collective memory 
there are innumerable statues commemorations books and archival collections 
the memory includes the home front military affairs the treatment of soldiers both living and dead in the wars aftermath depictions of the war in literature and art evaluations of heroes and villains and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war 
the last theme includes moral evaluations of racism and slavery heroism in combat and heroism behind the lines and the issues of democracy and minority rights as well as the notion of an empire of liberty influencing the world 
professional historians have paid much more attention to the causes of the war than to the war itself 
military history has largely developed outside academe leading to a proliferation of solid studies by non-scholars who are thoroughly familiar with the primary sources pay close attention to battles and campaigns and write for the large public readership rather than the small scholarly community 
bruce catton and shelby foote are among the best-known writers 
practically every major figure in the war both north and south has had a serious biographical study 
deeply religious southerners saw the hand of god in history which demonstrated his wrath at their sinfulness or his rewards for their suffering 
historian wilson fallin has examined the sermons of white and black baptist preachers after the war 
southern white preachers said
in sharp contrast black preachers interpreted the civil war as

memory of the war in the white south crystallized in the myth of the lost cause shaping regional identity and race relations for generations 
alan t nolan notes that the lost cause was expressly a rationalization a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame of those in rebellion 
some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery some appeals highlight cultural differences between north and south the military conflict by confederate actors is idealized in any case secession was said to be lawful 
nolan argues that the adoption of the lost cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the north and the south while excusing the virulent racism of the NUMth century sacrificing african-american progress to a white mans reunification 
he also deems the lost cause a caricature of the truth 
this caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter in every instance 
the interpretation of the civil war presented by charles a 
beard and mary r beard in the rise of american civilization NUM was highly influential among historians and the general public until the civil rights movement of the NUMs and NUMs 
the beards downplayed slavery abolitionism and issues of morality 
they ignored constitutional issues of states rights and even ignored american nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war 
indeed the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event 
much more important was the calculus of class conflict 
the beards announced that the civil war was really

the beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the NUMs and it became defunct among historians in the NUMs when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery 
however beardian themes still echo among lost cause writers 
the first efforts at civil war battlefield preservation and memorialization came during the war itself with the establishment of national cemeteries at gettysburg mill springs and chattanooga 
soldiers began erecting markers on battlefields beginning with the first battle of bull run in july NUM but the oldest surviving monument is the hazen monument erected at stones river near murfreesboro tennessee in the summer of NUM by soldiers in union col william b hazens brigade to mark the spot where they buried their dead in the battle of stones river 
in the NUMs the united states government established five civil war battlefield parks under the jurisdiction of the war department beginning with the creation of the chickamauga and chattanooga national military park in tennessee and the antietam national battlefield in maryland in NUM
the shiloh national military park was established in NUM followed by the gettysburg national military park in NUM and vicksburg national military park in NUM
in NUM these five parks and other national monuments were transferred to the jurisdiction of the national park service 
the modern civil war battlefield preservation movement began in NUM with the founding of the association for the preservation of civil war sites apcws a grassroots organization created by civil war historians and others to preserve battlefield land by acquiring it 
in NUM the original civil war trust was created in the mold of the statue of libertyellis island foundation but failed to attract corporate donors and soon helped manage the disbursement of us mint civil war commemorative coin revenues designated for battlefield preservation 
although the two organizations joined forces on a number of battlefield acquisitions ongoing conflicts prompted the boards of both organizations to facilitate a merger which happened in NUM with the creation of the civil war preservation trust 
in NUM the organization was renamed the civil war trust 
from NUM through late NUM the trust and its predecessor organizations saved more than NUM acres at NUM civil war battlefields and sites in NUM states 
the american civil war has been commemorated in many capacities ranging from the reenactment of battles to statues and memorial halls erected to films being produced to stamps and coins with civil war themes being issued all of which helped to shape public memory 
this varied advent occurred in greater proportions on the NUMth and NUMth anniversary 
hollywoods take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory as seen in such film classics as birth of a nation NUM gone with the wind NUM and more recently lincoln NUM
ken burns produced a notable pbs series on television titled the civil war NUM
it was digitally remastered and re-released in NUM
there were numerous technological innovations during the civil war that had a great impact on NUMth century science 
the civil war was one of the earliest examples of an industrial war in which technological might is used to achieve military supremacy in a war 
new inventions such as the train and telegraph delivered soldiers supplies and messages at a time when horses were considered to be the fastest way to travel 
it was also in this war when countries first used aerial warfare in the form of reconnaissance balloons to a significant effect 
it saw the first action involving steam-powered ironclad warships in naval warfare history 
repeating firearms such as the henry rifle spencer rifle colt revolving rifle triplett  scott carbine and others first appeared during the civil war they were a revolutionary invention that would soon replace muzzle-loading and single-shot firearms in warfare as well as the first appearances of rapid-firing weapons and machine guns such as the agar gun and the gatling gun

american english

american english ame ae ameng useng en-us sometimes called united states english or us english is the set of dialects of the english language native to the united states of america 
english is the most widely spoken language in the united states and is the common language used by the federal government to the extent that all laws and compulsory education are practiced in english 
though not an officially established language of the whole country english is considered the de facto language and is given official status by NUM of the NUM state governments 
as an example while both spanish and english have equivalent status in the local courts of puerto rico under federal law english is the official language for any matters being referred to the united states district court for the territory 
the use of english in the united states is a result of english and british colonization of the americas 
the first wave of english-speaking settlers arrived in north america during the NUMth century followed by further migrations in the NUMth and NUMth centuries 
since then american english has developed into new dialects in some cases under the influence of west african and native american languages german dutch irish spanish and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the united states 
american english varieties form a linguistic continuum of dialects more similar to each other than to english dialects of other countries including some common pronunciations and other features found nationwide 
any north american english accent perceived as free of noticeably local ethnic or cultural markers is popularly called general american a fairly uniform standard of broadcast mass media and the highly educated 
otherwise according to labov with the major exception of southern american english regional accents throughout the country are not yielding to this standard and historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single mainstream american accent 
on the contrary the sound of american english continues to evolve with some local accents disappearing but several larger regional accents emerging 
while written american english is largely standardized across the country there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary 
the regional sounds of present-day american english are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of both convergence and divergence some accents are homogenizing and levelling while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another 
in NUM william labov summarized the current state of regional american accents as follows

some regional american english has undergone vigorous new sound changes since the mid-nineteenth century onwards spawning relatively recent mid-atlantic centered on philadelphia and baltimore western pennsylvania centered on pittsburgh inland northern centered on chicago detroit and the great lakes region midland centered on indianapolis columbus and kansas city and western regional accents all of which are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago
meanwhile distinguishing features of the eastern new england centered on boston and new york city accents appear to be stable 
on the other hand dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns for example the traditional accents of charleston and of cincinnati have given way to the midland regional accent and of st louis now approaches the sounds of an inland northern or midland accent 
at the same time the southern regional accent despite the huge population it covers is on the whole slowly receding due to cultural stigma younger speakers everywhere in the south are shifting away from the marked features of southern speech 
finally the hoi toider dialect shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in the islands of north carolinas outer banks yet strengthening in the islands of the chesapeake bay 
below eleven major american english accents are defined by their particular combinations of certain characteristics

marked new england speech is mostly associated with eastern new england centering on boston and providence and traditionally includes some notable degree of r-dropping or non-rhoticity as well as the back tongue positioning of the vowel to  and the vowel to 
in and north of boston the sound is famously centralized or even fronted 
boston shows a cotcaught merger while providence keeps the same two vowels sharply distinct 
new york city english which prevails in a relatively small but nationally recognizable dialect region in and around new york city including long island and northeastern new jersey
its features include some notable degree of non-rhoticity and a locally unique short-a vowel pronunciation split 
new york city english otherwise broadly follows northern patterns except that the vowel is fronted 
the cotcaught merger is markedly resisted around new york city as depicted in popular stereotypes like tawwk and cawwfee with this vowel being typically tensed and diphthongal 
most older southern speech along the eastern seaboard was non-rhotic though today almost all local southern dialects are rhotic defined most recognizably by the vowel losing its gliding quality and approaching  the initiation event for the southern vowel shift which includes the southern drawl that makes short front vowels into gliding vowels 
since the mid-twentieth century a distinctive new northern speech pattern has developed near the canadian border of the united states centered on the central and eastern great lakes region but only on the american side
linguists call this region the inland north as defined by its local northern cities vowel shiftoccurring in the same region whose standard midwestern speech was the basis for general american in the mid-NUMth century though prior to this recent vowel shift at least other than general raising which may have existed since the NUMth century
the inland north accent was famously sketched on the television show saturday night lives bill swerskis superfans segments 
reversal of the shift at least of raising before non-nasal consonants and fronting has been observed in at least some communities in which it has been studied back towards general american values 
many people view the north central or upper midwestern accent from the stereotypical lens of the movie fargo
the north central accent is characterized by influences from the german and scandinavian settlers of the region like yah for yes pronounced similarly to ja in german norwegian and swedish
in parts of pennsylvania and ohio another dialect known as pennsylvania dutch english was also once spoken among the pennsylvania dutch community 
between the traditional american dialect areas of the north and south is what linguists have long called the midland
this geographically overlaps with some states situated in the lower midwest 
west of the appalachian mountains begins the broad zone of modern-day midland speech  
its vocabulary has been divided into two discrete subdivisions the north midland that begins north of the ohio river valley area and the south midland speech which to the american ear has a slight trace of the southern accent especially due to some degree of glide weakening
the south midland dialect follows the ohio river in a generally southwesterly direction moves across arkansas and oklahoma west of the mississippi and peters out in west texas 
modern midland speech is transitional regarding a presence or absence of the cotcaught merger 
historically pennsylvania was a home of the midland dialect however this state of early english-speaking settlers has now largely split off into new dialect regions with distinct philadelphia and pittsburgh dialects documented since the latter half of the twentieth century 
a generalized midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse western american english that unites the entire western half of the country 
this western dialect is mostly unified by a firm cotcaught merger and a conservatively backed pronunciation of the long oh sound in goat toe show etc  but a fronted pronunciation of the long oo sound in goose lose tune etc 
western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as pacific northwest english and california english with the native-speaker english of mexican americans also being a sub-type primarily of the western dialect 
the island state of hawaii though primarily english-speaking is also home to a creole language known commonly as hawaiian pidgin and some hawaii residents speak english with a pidgin-influenced accent 
although no longer region-specific african-american english which remains prevalent particularly among working- and middle-class african americans has a close relationship to southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many americans including hip hop culture 
the same aforementioned socioeconomic groups but among hispanic and latino americans have also developed native-speaker varieties of english 
the best-studied latino englishes are chicano english spoken in the west and midwest and new york latino english spoken in the new york metropolitan area 
additionally ethnic varieties such as yeshivish and yinglish are spoken by some american jews and cajun vernacular english by some cajuns in southern louisiana 
compared with english as spoken in england north american english is more homogeneous and any north american accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as general american 
this section mostly refers to such widespread or mainstream pronunciation features that characterize american english 
studies on historical usage of english in both the united states and the united kingdom suggest that spoken american english did not simply deviate away from period british english but retained certain now-archaic features contemporary british english has since lost 
one of these is the rhoticity common in most american accents because in the NUMth century when english was brought to the americas most english in england was also rhotic 
the preservation of rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of hiberno-english west country english and scottish english 
in most varieties of north american english the sound corresponding to the letter is a postalveolar approximant or retroflex approximant rather than a trill or tap as often heard for example in the english accents of scotland or india
a unique bunched tongue variant of the approximant r sound is also associated with the united states and seems particularly noticeable in the midwest and south 
traditionally the east coast comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions each of which possesses english varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse new england the new york metropolitan area the mid-atlantic states centering on philadelphia and baltimore and the southern united states 
the only traditionally r-dropping or non-rhotic regional accents of american english are all spoken along the atlantic coast and parts of the gulf coast particularly still in louisiana because these areas were in close historical contact with england and imitated prestigious varieties of r-dropping london a feature now widespread throughout most of england at a time when they were undergoing changes . today non-rhoticity is confined in the united states to the accents of eastern new england new york city older speakers of the former plantation south and african-american vernacular english though the vowel-consonant cluster found in bird work hurt learn etc 
usually retains its r pronunciation even in these non-rhotic accents
other than these few varieties american accents are rhotic pronouncing every instance of the sound 
many british accents have evolved in other ways compared to which general american english has remained relatively more conservative for example regarding the typical southern british features of a trapbath split fronting of  and h-dropping none of which typical american accents show 
the innovation of t glottaling which does occur before a consonant including a syllabic coronal nasal consonant like in the words button or satin and word-finally in general american additionally occurs variably between vowels in british english 
on the other hand general american is more innovative than the dialects of england or english elsewhere in the world in a number of its own ways



some mergers found in most varieties of both american and british english include

the process of coining new lexical items started as soon as english-speaking british-american colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora fauna and topography from the native american languages 
examples of such names are opossum raccoon squash moose from algonquian wigwam and moccasin
the languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the american vocabulary for instance cookie from dutch kindergarten from german levee from french and rodeo from spanish 
landscape features are often loanwords from french or spanish and the word corn used in england to refer to wheat or any cereal came to denote the maize plant the most important crop in the us 
most mexican spanish contributions came after the war of NUM with the opening of the west like ranch now a common house style
new forms of dwelling created new terms lot waterfront and types of homes like log cabin adobe in the NUMth century apartment  in the NUMth century project condominium townhouse mobile home in the NUMth century and parts thereof driveway breezeway backyard
industry and material innovations from the NUMth century onwards provide distinctive new words phrases and idioms through railroading see further at rail terminology and transportation terminology ranging from types of roads dirt roads freeways to infrastructure parking lot overpass rest area to automotive terminology often now standard in english internationally 
already existing english wordssuch as store shop lumberunderwent shifts in meaning others remained in the us while changing in britain 
from the world of business and finance came new terms merger downsize bottom line from sports and gambling terminology came specific jargon aside common everyday american idioms including many idioms related to baseball 
the names of some american inventions remained largely confined to north america elevator gasoline as did certain automotive terms truck trunk
new foreign loanwords came with NUMth and early NUMth century european immigration to the us  notably from yiddish chutzpah schmooze and german hamburger wiener
a large number of english colloquialisms from various periods are american in origin some have lost their american flavor from ok and cool to nerd and NUM while others have not have a nice day for sure many are now distinctly old-fashioned swell groovy.
some english words now in general use such as hijacking disc jockey boost bulldoze and jazz originated as american slang 
american english has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs 
examples of nouns that are now also verbs are interview advocate vacuum lobby pressure rear-end transition feature profile spearhead skyrocket showcase bad-mouth vacation major and many others 
compounds coined in the us are for instance foothill landslide in all senses  teenager
brainstorm  hitchhike smalltime and a huge number of others 
some are euphemistic human resources affirmative action correctional facility.
many compound nouns have the verb-and-preposition combination stopover lineup tryout spin-off shootout holdup hideout comeback makeover and many more 
some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of american origin win out hold up back upoffdownout face up to and many others
noun endings such as -ee retiree -ery bakery -ster gangster and -cian beautician are also particularly productive in the us several verbs ending in -ize are of us origin for example fetishize prioritize burglarize accessorize weatherize etc and so are some back-formations locate fine-tune curate donate emote upholster and enthuse.
among syntactical constructions that arose are outside of headed for meet up with back of etc 
americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably pesky phony rambunctious buddy sundae skeeter sashay and kitty-corner 
adjectives that arose in the us are for example lengthy bossy cute and cutesy punk in all senses sticky of the weather through as in finished and many colloquial forms such as peppy or wacky
a number of words and meanings that originated in middle english or early modern english and that have been in everyday use in the united states have since disappeared in most varieties of british english some of these have cognates in lowland scots 
terms such as fall autumn faucet tap diaper nappy candy sweets skillet eyeglasses and obligate are often regarded as americanisms 
fall for example came to denote the season in NUMth century england a contraction of middle english expressions like fall of the leaf and fall of the year
gotten past participle of get is often considered to be largely an americanism . other words and meanings were brought back to britain from the us  especially in the second half of the NUMth century these include hire to employ i guess famously criticized by h w fowler baggage hit a place and the adverbs overly and presently currently
some of these for example monkey wrench and wastebasket originated in NUMth century britain 
the adjectives mad meaning angry smart meaning intelligent and sick meaning ill are also more frequent in american and irish english than british english 
linguist bert vaux created a survey completed in NUM polling english speakers across the united states about their specific everyday word choices hoping to identify regionalisms 
the study found that most americans prefer the term sub for a long sandwich soda but pop in the great lakes region and generic coke in the south for a sweet and bubbly soft drink you or you guys for the plural of you but yall in the south sneakers for athletic shoes but often tennis shoes outside the northeast and shopping cart for a cart used for carrying supermarket goods 
american english and british english bre often differ at the levels of phonology phonetics vocabulary and to a much lesser extent grammar and orthography 
the first large american dictionary an american dictionary of the english language known as websters dictionary was written by noah webster in NUM codifying several of these spellings 
differences in grammar are relatively minor and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility these include different use of some auxiliary verbs formal rather than notional agreement with collective nouns different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs for example amebre learnedlearnt burnedburnt snucksneaked dovedived although the purportedly british forms can occasionally be seen in american english writing as well different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts for example ame in school bre at school and whether or not a definite article is used in very few cases ame to the hospital bre to hospital contrast however ame actress elizabeth taylor bre the actress elizabeth taylor
often these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules and most are not stable since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other and american english is not a standardized set of dialects 
differences in orthography are also minor 
the main differences are that american english usually uses spellings such as flavor for british flavour fiber for fibre defense for defence analyze for analyse license for licence catalog for catalogue and traveling for travelling
noah webster popularized such spellings in america but he did not invent most of them 
rather he chose already existing options ... on such grounds as simplicity analogy or etymology
other differences are due to the francophile tastes of the NUMth century victorian era britain for example they preferred programme for program manoeuvre for maneuver cheque for check etc 
ame almost always uses -ize in words like realize
bre prefers -ise but also uses -ize on occasion see oxford spelling
there are a few differences in punctuation rules 
british english is more tolerant of run-on sentences called comma splices in american english and american english requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which british rules would place them outside 
american english also favors the double quotation mark over single 
ame sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex whereas bre uses clipped forms such as ame transportation and bre transport or where the british form is a back-formation such as ame burglarize and bre burgle from burglar
however while individuals usually use one or the other both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems 
british english also differs from american english in that schedule can be pronounced with either sk or

hemingways mother frequently performed in concerts around the village 
as an adult hemingway professed to hate his mother although biographer michael s reynolds points out that hemingway mirrored her energy and enthusiasm

he could not say how scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in english if his leg was coming off or not 
in september he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of michigans upper peninsula

hemingway was devastated having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties the letter arrived minutes after the suicide 
he realized how hadley must have felt after her own fathers suicide in NUM and he commented ill probably go the same way 
upon his return to key west in december hemingway worked on the draft of a farewell to arms before leaving for france in january 
he had finished it in august but delayed the revision 
the serialization in scribners magazine was scheduled to begin in may but as late as april hemingway was still working on the ending which he may have rewritten as many as seventeen times

in spain in mid-NUM hemingway researched his next work death in the afternoon
he wanted to write a comprehensive treatise on bullfighting explaining the toreros and corridas complete with glossaries and appendices because he believed bullfighting was of great tragic interest being literally of life and death

the incident changed dos passos initially positive opinion of the leftist republicans creating a rift between him and hemingway who later spread a rumor that dos passos left spain out of cowardice 
journalist and writer martha gellhorn whom hemingway had met in key west the previous christmas NUM joined him in spain 
like hadley martha was a st louis native and like pauline she had worked for vogue in paris 
of martha kert explains she never catered to him the way other women did
late in NUM while in madrid with martha hemingway wrote his only play the fifth column as the city was being bombarded by francoist forces 
he returned to key west for a few months then back to spain twice in NUM where he was present at the battle of the ebro the last republican stand and he was among the british and american journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river 
in early NUM hemingway crossed to cuba in his boat to live in the hotel ambos mundos in havana 
this was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from pauline which had begun when hemingway met martha gellhorn 
martha soon joined him in cuba and they almost immediately rented finca vigia lookout farm a property from havana 
pauline and the children left hemingway that summer after the family was reunited during a visit to wyoming and when hemingways divorce from pauline was finalized he and martha were married on november NUM NUM in cheyenne wyoming 
as he had after his divorce from hadley he changed locations moving his primary summer residence to ketchum idaho just outside the newly built resort of sun valley and his winter residence to cuba 
hemingway who had been disgusted when a parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table became enamored of cats in cuba keeping dozens of them on the property 
gellhorn inspired him to write his most famous novel for whom the bell tolls which he started in march NUM and finished in july NUM
it was published in october NUM
consistent with his pattern of moving around while working on a manuscript he wrote for whom the bell tolls in cuba wyoming and sun valley 
for whom the bell tolls became a book-of-the-month club choice sold half a million copies within months was nominated for a pulitzer prize and as meyers describes it triumphantly re-established hemingways literary reputation
in january NUM martha was sent to china on assignment for colliers magazine 
hemingway went with her sending in dispatches for the newspaper pm but in general he disliked china 
a NUM book suggests during that period he may have been recruited to work for soviet intelligence agents under the name agent argo
they returned to cuba before the declaration of war by the united states that december when he convinced the cuban government to help him refit the pilar which he intended to use to ambush german submarines off the coast of cuba 
from may NUM to march NUM hemingway was in london and europe 
when hemingway first arrived in london he met time magazine correspondent mary welsh with whom he became infatuated 
martha had been forced to cross the atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because hemingway refused to help her get a press pass on a plane and she arrived in london to find hemingway hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident 
unsympathetic to his plight she accused him of being a bully and told him that she was through absolutely finished
the last time that hemingway saw martha was in march NUM as he was preparing to return to cuba and their divorce was finalized later that same year 
meanwhile he had asked mary welsh to marry him on their third meeting 
hemingway was present at the normandy landings wearing a large head bandage but according to meyers he was considered precious cargo and not allowed ashore 
the landing craft came within sight of omaha beach before coming under enemy fire and turning back 
hemingway later wrote in colliers that he could see the first second third fourth and fifth waves of landing troops lay where they had fallen looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pebbly stretch between the sea and first cover
mellow explains that on that first day none of the correspondents were allowed to land and hemingway was returned to the dorothea dix
late in july he attached himself to the NUMnd infantry regiment commanded by col charles buck lanham as it drove toward paris and hemingway became de facto leader to a small band of village militia in rambouillet outside of paris 
of hemingways exploits paul fussell historian and critic of the literature of the two world wars remarks hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops even if he does it well 
this was in fact in contravention of the geneva convention and hemingway was brought up on formal charges he said that he beat the rap by claiming that he only offered advice 
on august NUM he was present at the liberation of paris although contrary to the hemingway legend he was not the first into the city nor did he liberate the ritz 
in paris he visited sylvia beach and pablo picasso with mary welsh who joined him there in a spirit of happiness he forgave gertrude stein 
later that year he was present at heavy fighting in the battle of hrtgen forest 
on december NUM NUM a feverish and ill hemingway had himself driven to luxembourg to cover what was later called the battle of the bulge 
as soon as he arrived however lanham handed him to the doctors who hospitalized him with pneumonia by the time that he recovered a week later most of the fighting in this battle was over 
in NUM hemingway was awarded a bronze star for his bravery during world warii 
he was recognized for his valor having been under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions with the commendation that through his talent of expression mr hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his organization in combat
hemingway said he was out of business as a writer from NUM to NUM during his residence in cuba 
in NUM he married mary who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later 
the hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war in a NUM car accident he smashed his knee and sustained another deep wound on his forehead mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents 
a NUM car accident left patrick with a head wound and severely ill hemingway sank into depression as his literary friends began to die in NUM william butler yeats and ford madox ford in NUM scott fitzgerald in NUM sherwood anderson and james joyce in NUM gertrude stein and the following year in NUM max perkins hemingways long-time scribners editor and friend 
during this period he suffered from severe headaches high blood pressure weight problems and eventually diabetesmuch of which was the result of previous accidents and many years of heavy drinking 
nonetheless in january NUM he began work on the garden of eden finishing NUM pages by june 
during the postwar years he also began work on a trilogy tentatively titled the land the sea and the air which he wanted to combine in one novel titled the sea book
however both projects stalled and mellow says that hemingways inability to continue was a symptom of his troubles during these years 
in NUM hemingway and mary traveled to europe staying in venice for several months 
while there hemingway fell in love with the then NUM-year-old adriana ivancich 
the platonic love affair inspired the novel across the river and into the trees written in cuba during a time of strife with mary and published in NUM to negative reviews 
the following year furious at the critical reception of across the river and into the trees he wrote the draft of the old man and the sea in eight weeks saying that it was the best i can write ever for all of my life
the old man and the sea became a book-of-the-month selection made hemingway an international celebrity and won the pulitzer prize in may NUM a month before he left for his second trip to africa 
in NUM while in africa hemingway was almost fatally injured in two successive plane crashes 
he chartered a sightseeing flight over the belgian congo as a christmas present to mary 
on their way to photograph murchison falls from the air the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and crash landed in heavy brush
hemingways injuries included a head wound while mary broke two ribs 
the next day attempting to reach medical care in entebbe they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off with hemingway suffering burns and another concussion this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid 
they eventually arrived in entebbe to find reporters covering the story of hemingways death 
he briefed the reporters and spent the next few weeks recuperating and reading his erroneous obituaries 
despite his injuries hemingway accompanied patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in february but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with 
when a bushfire broke out he was again injured sustaining second degree burns on his legs front torso lips left hand and right forearm 
months later in venice mary reported to friends the full extent of hemingways injuries two cracked discs a kidney and liver rupture a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull 
the accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow 
after the plane crashes hemingway who had been a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries 
in october NUM hemingway received the nobel prize in literature 
he modestly told the press that carl sandburg isak dinesen and bernard berenson deserved the prize but he gladly accepted the prize money 
mellow claims hemingway had coveted the nobel prize but when he won it months after his plane accidents and the ensuing worldwide press coverage there must have been a lingering suspicion in hemingways mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academys decision 
because he was suffering pain from the african accidents he decided against traveling to stockholm 
instead he sent a speech to be read defining the writers life 

from the end of the year in NUM to early NUM hemingway was bedridden 
he was told to stop drinking to mitigate liver damage advice he initially followed but then disregarded 
in october NUM he returned to europe and met basque writer pio baroja who was seriously ill and died weeks later 
during the trip hemingway became sick again and was treated for high blood pressure liver disease and arteriosclerosis
in november NUM while staying in paris he was reminded of trunks he had stored in the ritz hotel in NUM and never retrieved 
upon re-claiming and opening the trunks hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his paris years 
excited about the discovery when he returned to cuba in early NUM he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir a moveable feast
by NUM he ended a period of intense activity he finished a moveable feast scheduled to be released the following year brought true at first light to NUM words added chapters to the garden of eden and worked on islands in the stream
the last three were stored in a safe deposit box in havana as he focused on the finishing touches for a moveable feast
author michael reynolds claims it was during this period that hemingway slid into depression from which he was unable to recover 
the finca vigia became crowded with guests and tourists as hemingway beginning to become unhappy with life there considered a permanent move to idaho 
in NUM he bought a home overlooking the big wood river outside ketchum and left cubaalthough he apparently remained on easy terms with the castro government telling the new york times he was delighted with castros overthrow of batista 
he was in cuba in november NUM between returning from pamplona and traveling west to idaho and the following year for his NUMth birthday however that year he and mary decided to leave after hearing the news that castro wanted to nationalize property owned by americans and other foreign nationals 
on july NUM NUM the hemingways left cuba for the last time leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in havana 
after the NUM bay of pigs invasion the finca vigia was expropriated by the cuban government complete with hemingways collection of four to six thousand books
through the end of the NUMs hemingway continued to rework the material that would be published as a moveable feast
in mid-NUM he visited spain to research a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by life magazine 
life wanted only NUMwords but the manuscript grew out of control 
for the first time in his life unable to organize his writing he asked a e hotchner to travel to cuba to help him 
hotchner helped him trim the life piece down to NUM words and scribners agreed to a full-length book version the dangerous summer of almost NUM words 
hotchner found hemingway to be unusually hesitant disorganized and confused and suffering badly from failing eyesight 
on july NUM NUM hemingway and mary left cuba never to return 
during the summer of NUM he set up a small office in his new york city apartment and attempted to work 
he left new york city for good soon after 
he then traveled alone to spain to be photographed for the front cover for the life magazine piece 
a few days later he was reported in the news to be seriously ill and on the verge of dying which panicked mary until she received a cable from him telling her reports false 
enroute madrid 
love papa 
however he was seriously ill and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown 
he was lonely and took to his bed for days retreating into silence despite having had the first installments of the dangerous summer published in life in september NUM to good reviews 
in october he left spain for new york where he refused to leave marys apartment on the pretext that he was being watched 
she quickly took him to idaho where george saviers a sun valley physician met them at the train 
at this time hemingway was constantly worried about money and his safety 
he worried about his taxes and that he would never return to cuba to retrieve the manuscripts he had left there in a bank vault 
he became paranoid thinking the fbi was actively monitoring his movements in ketchum 
the fbi had in fact opened a file on him during world war ii when he used the pilar to patrol the waters off cuba and j edgar hoover had an agent in havana watch hemingway during the NUMs 
by the end of november mary was at her wits end and saviers suggested hemingway go to the mayo clinic in minnesota and hemingway may have believed he was to be treated there for hypertension 
the fbi knew hemingway was at the mayo clinic as an agent later documented in a letter written in january NUM
in an attempt to maintain anonymity hemingway was checked in at the mayo clinic under savierss name 
meyers writes that an aura of secrecy surrounds hemingways treatment at the mayo but confirms he was treated with electroconvulsive therapy as many as NUM times in december NUM and was released in ruins in january NUM
reynolds was able to access hemingways records at the mayo which indicated that the combination of medications given to hemingway may have created the depressive state for which he was treated 
three months after hemingway was released from the mayo clinic when he was back in ketchum in april NUM mary found hemingway holding a shotgun in the kitchen one morning 
she called saviers who sedated him and admitted him to the sun valley hospital from there he was returned to the mayo clinic for more electroshock treatments 
he was released in late june and arrived home in ketchum on june NUM
two days later in the early morning hours of july NUM NUM hemingway quite deliberately shot himself with his favorite shotgun 
he had unlocked the basement storeroom where his guns were kept gone upstairs to the front entrance foyer of their ketchum home and according to mellow shot himself with the double-barreled shotgun that he had used so often it might have been a friend
mary called the sun valley hospital and a doctor quickly arrived at the house who determined hemingway had died of a self-inflicted wound to the head
mary was sedated and taken to the hospital returning home the next day where she cleaned the house and saw to the funeral arrangements and travel arrangements 
bernice kert writes that at that time it did not seem to her a conscious lie when she told the press ernests death had been accidental.
in a press interview five years later mary hemingway confirmed that her husband had shot himself 
family and friends flew to ketchum for the funeral officiated by the local catholic priest who believed hemingways death accidental 
of the funeral during which an altar boy fainted at the head of the casket hemingways brother leicester wrote it seemed to me ernest would have approved of it all 
he is buried in the ketchum cemetery 
hemingways behavior during his final years had been similar to that of his fathers before he killed himself his father may have had the genetic disease hemochromatosis due to which the inability to metabolize iron culminates in mental and physical deterioration 
medical records made available in NUM confirm that hemingway had been diagnosed with hemochromatosis in early NUM
his sister ursula and his brother leicester also killed themselves 
in addition to being affected by his physical ailments hemingways health was compromised by his having been a heavy drinker for most of his life 
in NUM a memorial to ernest hemingway was placed just north of sun valley above trail creek 
at its base is inscribed a eulogy hemingway wrote for a friend several decades earlier

now he will be a part of them forever 
the new york times wrote in NUM of hemingways first novel no amount of analysis can convey the quality of the sun also rises
it is a truly gripping story told in a lean hard athletic narrative prose that puts more literary english to shame 
the sun also rises is written in the spare tight prose that made hemingway famous and according to james nagel changed the nature of american writing 
in NUM when hemingway was awarded the nobel prize for literature it was for his mastery of the art of narrative most recently demonstrated in the old man and the sea and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style 
henry louis gates believes hemingways style was fundamentally shaped in reaction to his experience of world war
after world wari he and other modernists lost faith in the central institutions of western civilization by reacting against the elaborate style of NUMth-century writers and by creating a style in which meaning is established through dialogue through action and silencesa fiction in which nothing crucialor at least very littleis stated explicitly 
because he began as a writer of short stories baker believes hemingway learned to get the most from the least how to prune language how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth 
hemingway called his style the iceberg theory the facts float above water the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight 
the concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the theory of omission
hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing such as nick adams fishing in the big two-hearted river though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface nick adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else
paul smith writes that hemingways first stories collected as in our time showed he was still experimenting with his writing style 
he avoided complicated syntax 
about NUM percent of the sentences are simple sentencesa childlike syntax without subordination 
jackson benson believes hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in generalnot only about his life 
for example benson postulates that hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with what if scenarios what if i were wounded in such a way that i could not sleep at night
what if i were wounded and made crazy what would happen if i were sent back to the front
writing in the art of the short story hemingway explains a few things i have found to be true 
if you leave out important things or events that you know about the story is strengthened 
if you leave or skip something because you do not know it the story will be worthless 
the test of any story is how very good the stuff that you not your editors omit 
the simplicity of the prose is deceptive 
zoe trodd believes hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to henry jamess observation that world wari had used up words
hemingway offers a multi-focal photographic reality 
his iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds 
the syntax which lacks subordinating conjunctions creates static sentences 
the photographic snapshot style creates a collage of images 
many types of internal punctuation colons semicolons dashes parentheses are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences 
the sentences build on each other as events build to create a sense of the whole 
multiple strands exist in one story an embedded text bridges to a different angle 
he also uses other cinematic techniques of cutting quickly from one scene to the next or of splicing a scene into another 
intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap as though responding to instructions from the author and create three-dimensional prose 
hemingway habitually used the word and in place of commas 
this use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy 
hemingways polysyndetonic sentenceor in later works his use of subordinate clausesuses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images 
benson compares them to haikus 
many of hemingways followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion saul bellow satirized this style as do you have emotions
strangle them 
however hemingways intent was not to eliminate emotion but to portray it more scientifically 
hemingway thought it would be easy and pointless to describe emotions he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp the real thing the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or with luck and if you stated it purely enough always
this use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of ezra pound t s eliot james joyce and proust 
hemingways letters refer to prousts remembrance of things past several times over the years and indicate he read the book at least twice 
the popularity of hemingways work depends on its themes of love war wilderness and loss all of which are strongly evident in the body of work 
these are recurring themes in american literature and are quite clearly evident in hemingways work 
critic leslie fiedler sees the theme he defines as the sacred landthe american westextended in hemingways work to include mountains in spain switzerland and africa and to the streams of michigan 
the american west is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the hotel montana in the sun also rises and for whom the bell tolls
according to stoltzfus and fiedler in hemingways work nature is a place for rebirth and rest and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey 
nature is where men exist without women men fish men hunt men find redemption in nature 
although hemingway does write about sports such as fishing carlos baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport 
at its core much of hemingways work can be viewed in the light of american naturalism evident in detailed descriptions such as those in big two-hearted river
fiedler believes hemingway inverts the american literary theme of the evil dark woman versus the good light woman
the dark womanbrett ashley of the sun also risesis a goddess the light womanmargot macomber of the short happy life of francis macomberis a murderess 
robert scholes admits that early hemingway stories such as a very short story present a male character favorably and a female unfavorably
according to rena sanderson early hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits and the fiction divided women into castrators or love-slaves
feminist critics attacked hemingway as public enemy number one although more recent re-evaluations of his work have given new visibility to hemingways female characters and their strengths and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine 
nina baym believes that brett ashley and margot macomber are the two outstanding examples of hemingways bitch women 
the theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as indian camp
the theme of death permeates hemingways work 
young believes the emphasis in indian camp was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself but on nick adams who witnesses these events as a child and becomes a badly scarred and nervous young man
hemingway sets the events in indian camp that shape the adams persona 
young believes indian camp holds the master key to what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career
stoltzfus considers hemingways work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism if nothingness is embraced then redemption is achieved at the moment of death 
those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life 
francis macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity 
in his paper the uses of authenticity hemingway and the literary field timo mller writes that hemingways fiction is successful because the characters live an authentic life and the soldiers fishers boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature
the theme of emasculation is prevalent in hemingways work most notably in the sun also rises
emasculation according to fiedler is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers and of a generation in which women such as brett gained emancipation 
this also applies to the minor character frances clyne cohns girlfriend in the beginning in the book 
her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times 
baker believes hemingways work emphasizes the natural versus the unnatural
in alpine idyll the unnaturalness of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the unnaturalness of the peasant who allowed his wifes dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter 
the skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the natural spring for redemption 
susan beegel has written that some more recent criticswriting through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after hemingways death and more than half a century after his novels were first publishedhave characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as misogynistic and homophobic 
in her NUM essay critical reception beegel analyzed four decades of hemingway criticism and found that critics interested in multiculturalism particularly in the NUMs simply ignored hemingway although some apologetics have been written 
typical according to beegel is an analysis of hemingways NUM novel the sun also rises in which a critic contended hemingway never lets the reader forget that cohn is a jew not an unattractive character who happens to be a jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a jew 
also during the NUMs according to beegel criticism was published that focused on investigating the horror of homosexuality and the racism typical of the social era portrayed in hemingways fiction 
in an overall assessment of hemingways work beegel has written throughout his remarkable body of fiction he tells the truth about human fear guilt betrayal violence cruelty drunkenness hunger greed apathy ecstasy tenderness love and lust 
hemingways legacy to american literature is his style writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it 
after his reputation was established with the publication of the sun also rises he became the spokesperson for the postworld wari generation having established a style to follow 
his books were burned in berlin in NUM as being a monument of modern decadence and disavowed by his parents as filth
reynolds asserts the legacy is that hemingway left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage 
benson believes the details of hemingways life have become a prime vehicle for exploitation resulting in a hemingway industry 
hemingway scholar hallengren believes the hard boiled style and the machismo must be separated from the author himself 
benson agrees describing him as introverted and private as j d salinger although hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio 
during world warii salinger met and corresponded with hemingway whom he acknowledged as an influence 
in a letter to hemingway salinger claimed their talks had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war and jokingly named himself national chairman of the hemingway fan clubs 
the extent of hemingways influence is seen in the tributes and echoes of his fiction in popular culture 
a minor planet discovered in NUM by soviet astronomer nikolai chernykh was named for him NUM hemingway ray bradbury wrote the kilimanjaro device with hemingway transported to the top of mount kilimanjaro the NUM motion picture wrestling ernest hemingway about the friendship of two retired men irish and cuban in a seaside town in florida starred robert duvall richard harris shirley maclaine sandra bullock and piper laurie 
the influence is evident with the many restaurants named hemingway and the proliferation of bars called harrys a nod to the bar in across the river and into the trees
a line of hemingway furniture promoted by hemingways son jack bumby has pieces such as the kilimanjaro bedside table and a catherine slip-covered sofa 
montblanc offers a hemingway fountain pen and a line of hemingway safari clothes has been created 
the international imitation hemingway competition was created in NUM to publicly acknowledge his influence and the comically misplaced efforts of lesser authors to imitate his style 
entrants are encouraged to submit one really good page of really bad hemingway and winners are flown to italy to harrys bar 
in NUM mary hemingway established the hemingway foundation and in the NUMs she donated her husbands papers to the john f kennedy library 
in NUM a group of hemingway scholars gathered to assess the donated papers subsequently forming the hemingway society committed to supporting and fostering hemingway scholarship 
almost exactly NUM years after hemingways death on july NUM NUM his granddaughter margaux hemingway died in santa monica california 
margaux was a supermodel and actress co-starring with her younger sister mariel in the NUM movie lipstick
her death was later ruled a suicide making her the fifth person in four generations of her family to commit suicide 
three houses associated with hemingway are listed on the us national register of historic places the ernest hemingway cottage on walloon lake michigan designated in NUM the ernest hemingway house in key west designated in NUM and the ernest and mary hemingway house in ketchum designated in NUM
his boyhood home in oak park illinois is a museum and archive dedicated to hemingway 
in NUM he was inducted into the chicago literary hall of fame

fantastic four

the fantastic four is a fictional superhero team appearing in american comic books published by marvel comics 
the group debuted in the fantastic four NUM cover dated nov NUM which helped to usher in a new level of realism in the medium 
the fantastic four was the first superhero team created by editorco-plotter stan lee and artistco-plotter jack kirby who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on 
the four individuals traditionally associated with the fantastic four who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to outer space are mister fantastic reed richards a scientific genius and the leader of the group who can stretch his body into incredible lengths and shapes the invisible woman susan sue storm who eventually married reed who can render herself invisible and later project powerful invisible force fields the human torch johnny storm sues younger brother who can generate flames surround himself with them and fly and the monstrous thing ben grimm their grumpy but benevolent friend a former college football star and reeds college roommate as well as a good pilot who possesses tremendous superhuman strength durability and endurance due to the nature of his stone-like flesh 
since their original NUM introduction the fantastic four have been portrayed as a somewhat dysfunctional yet loving family 
breaking convention with other comic book archetypes of the time they would squabble and hold grudges both deep and petty and eschewed anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status 
the team is also well known for its recurring encounters with characters such as the villainous monarch doctor doom the planet-devouring galactus the sea-dwelling prince namor the spacefaring silver surfer and the shape-changing alien skrulls 
the fantastic four have been adapted into other media including four animated series and four live-action films 
apocryphal legend has it that in NUM longtime magazine and comic book publisher martin goodman was playing golf with either jack liebowitz or irwin donenfeld of rival company dc comics then known as national periodical publications and that the top executive bragged about dcs success with the new superhero team the justice league of america 
while film producer and comics historian michael uslan has debunked the particulars of that story goodman a publishing trend-follower aware of the jlas strong sales did direct his comics editor stan lee to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes 
according to lee writing in NUM martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by national comics seemed to be selling better than most 
it was a book called the justice league of america and it was composed of a team of superheroes 
... if the justice league is selling spoke he why dont we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes
lee who had served as editor-in-chief and art director of marvel comics and its predecessor companies timely comics and atlas comics for two decades found that the medium had become creatively restrictive 
determined to carve a real career for myself in the nowhere world of comic books lee concluded that for just this once i would do the type of story i myself would enjoy reading .. and the characters would be the kind of characters i could personally relate to theyd be flesh and blood theyd have their faults and foibles theyd be fallible and feisty and  most important of all  inside their colorful costumed booties theyd still have feet of clay 
lee said he created a synopsis for the first fantastic four story that he gave to penciller jack kirby who then drew the entire story 
kirby turned in his penciled art pages to lee who added dialogue and captions 
this approach to creating comics which became known as the marvel method worked so well for lee and kirby that they used it from then on the marvel method became standard for the company within a year 
kirby recalled events somewhat differently 
challenged with lees version of events in a NUM interview kirby responded i would say thats an outright lie although the interviewer gary groth notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution 
kirby claims he came up with the idea for the fantastic four in marvels offices and that lee had merely added the dialogue after the story had been pencilled 
kirby also sought to establish more credibly and on numerous occasions that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions 
he regularly pointed to a team he had created for rival publisher dc comics in the NUMs the challengers of the unknown 
if you notice the uniforms theyre the same .
i always give them a skintight uniform with a belt .. the challengers and the ff have a minimum of decoration 
and of course the things skin is a kind of decoration breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform 
the chest insignia of a NUM within a circle however was designed by lee 
the characters wear no uniforms in the first two issues 
given the conflicting statements outside commentators have found it hard to identify with precise detail who created the fantastic four 
although stan lees typed synopsis for the fantastic four exists earl wells writing in the comics journal points out that its existence does not assert its place in the creation we have no way of knowing of whether lee wrote the synopsis after a discussion with kirby in which kirby supplied most of the ideas
comics historian r c harvey believes that the fantastic four was a furtherance of the work kirby had been doing previously and so more likely kirbys creations than lees
but harvey notes that the marvel method of collaboration allowed each man to claim credit and that lees dialogue added to the direction the team took 
wells argues that it was lees contributions which set the framework within which kirby worked and this made lee more responsible
comics historian mark evanier a studio assistant to jack kirby in the NUMs says that the considered opinion of lee and kirbys contemporaries was that fantastic four was created by stan and jack 
no further division of credit seemed appropriate
the release of the fantastic four NUM nov NUM was an unexpected success 
lee had felt ready to leave the comics field at the time but the positive response to fantastic four persuaded him to stay on

these earliest issues were published bimonthly 
with issue NUM july NUM the cover title dropped its the and became simply fantastic four
while the early stories were complete narratives the frequent appearances of these two antagonists doom and namor in subsequent issues indicated the creation of a long narrative by lee and kirby that extended over months 
according to comics historian les daniels only narratives that ran to several issues would be able to contain their increasingly complex ideas
during its creators lengthy run the series produced many acclaimed storylines and characters that have become central to marvel including the hidden race of alien-human genetic experiments the inhumans the black panther an african king who would be mainstream comics first black superhero the rival alien races the kree and the shapeshifting skrulls him who would become adam warlock the negative zone and unstable molecules 
the story frequently cited as lee and kirbys finest achievement is the three-part galactus trilogy that began in fantastic four NUM march NUM chronicling the arrival of galactus a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet and his herald the silver surfer 
fantastic four NUM was chosen as NUM in the NUM greatest marvels of all time poll of marvels readers in NUM
editor robert greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that as the fourth year of the fantastic four came to a close stan lee and jack kirby seemed to be only warming up 
in retrospect it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the marvel age 
daniels noted that the mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the NUMs and lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses 
the fantastic four annual was used to spotlight several key events 
the sub-mariner was crowned king of atlantis in the first annual NUM
the following years annual revealed the origin story of doctor doom

NUM instead 
writer doug moench and penciller bill sienkiewicz then took over for NUM issues 
with issue NUM july NUM the aptly titled back to the basics byrne began his run as writer penciller and inker the last under the pseudonym bjorn heyn for this issue only 
byrne revitalized the slumping title with his run 
originally byrne was slated to write with sienkiewicz providing the art 
sienkiewicz left to do moon knight and byrne subsequently became writer artist and inker 
various editors were assigned to the comic eventually bob budiansky became the regular editor 
byrne told jim shooter that he could not work with budiansky although they ultimately continued to work together 
in NUM byrne said thats my paranoia 
i look back and i think that was shooter trying to force me off the book
byrne left following issue NUM aug NUM in the middle of a story arc explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series 
one of byrnes changes was making the invisible girl into the invisible woman assertive and confident 
during this period fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful whereas previously she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by donna reed and florence henderson 
byrne staked new directions in the characters personal lives having the married sue storm and reed richards suffer a miscarriage and the thing quitting the fantastic four with she-hulk being recruited as his long-term replacement 
he also re-emphasized the family dynamic which he felt the series had drifted away from after the leekirby run commenting that familyand not dysfunctional familyis the central key element to the ff 
it is an absolutely vital dynamic between the characters 
emphases in original

byrne was followed by a quick succession of writers roger stern tom defalco and roy thomas 
steve englehart took over as writer for issues NUM except NUM
the title had been struggling so englehart decided to make radical changes 
he felt the title had become stale with the normal makeup of reed sue ben and johnny so in issue NUM reed and sue retired and were replaced with the things new girlfriend sharon ventura and johnny storms former love crystal 
the changes increased readership through issue NUM
at this point marvel made decisions about another englehart comic west coast avengers that he disagreed with and in protest he changed his byline to sf x 
englehart sf x 
is the abbreviation for simple sound effects
in issue NUM englehart was told to bring reed and sue back and undo the other changes he had made 
this caused englehart to take his name entirely off the book 
he used the pseudonym john harkness which he had created years before for work he didnt want to be associated with 
according to englehart the run from NUM through his last issue NUM was one of the most painful stretches of his career 
writer-artist walt simonson took over as writer with NUM december NUM and three issues later began pencilling and inking as well 
with brief inking exceptions two fill-in issues and a three-issue stint drawn by arthur adams simonson remained in all three positions through NUM july NUM
simonson who had been writing the team comic the avengers had gotten approval for reed and sue to join that team after engelhart had written them out of fantastic four
yet by the avengers NUM where they were scheduled to join the team simonson was told the characters were returning to fantastic four
this led to simonson quitting the avengers after that issue 
shortly afterward he was offered the job of writing fantastic four
having already prepared a number of stories involving the avengers with reed and sue in the lineup he then rewrote these for fantastic four
simonson later recalled that working on fantastic four allowed him the latitude to use original avengers members thor and iron man which he had been precluded from using in the avengers
after another fill-in the regular team of writer and marvel editor-in-chief tom defalco penciller paul ryan and inker dan bulanadi took over with ryan self-inking beginning with NUM jan NUM
that team with the very occasional different inker continued for years through NUM july NUM
defalco nullified the storm-masters marriage by retconning that the alien skrull empire had kidnapped the real masters and replaced her with a spy named lyja 
once discovered lyja who herself had fallen for storm helped the fantastic four rescue masters 
ventura departed after being further mutated by doctor doom 
although some fans were not pleased with defalcos run on fantastic four calling him the great satan the titles sales increased over the period 
other key developments included franklin richards being sent into the future and returning as a teenager the return of reeds time-traveling father nathaniel who is revealed to be the father of time-travelling villain kang the conqueror and reeds apparent death at the hands of a seemingly mortally wounded doctor doom

upon exiting the rocket the four discover they have developed incredible superpowers and decide to use these powers to help others 
in the first issue the crew talks about reed richards rocketship flying to the stars 
stan lees original synopsis described the crews plan to fly to mars but lee later shortly afterward wrote that due to the rate the communists are progressing in space maybe we better make this a flight to the stars instead of just to mars because by the time this mag goes on sale the russians may have already made a flight to mars
in a significant departure from preceding superhero conventions the fantastic four make no effort to maintain secret identities or until issue NUM to wear superhero costumes instead maintaining a public profile and enjoying celebrity status for scientific and heroic contributions to society 
at the same time they are often prone to arguing and even fighting with one another 
despite their bickering the fantastic four consistently prove themselves to be a cohesive and formidable team in times of crisis 
while there have been a number of lineup changes to the group the four characters who debuted in fantastic four NUM remain the core and most frequent lineup 
the fantastic four has had several different headquarters most notably the baxter building located at NUMnd street and madison avenue in new york city 
the baxter building was replaced by four freedoms plaza at the same location after its destruction at the hands of kristoff vernard adopted son of the teams seminal foe doctor doom 
prior to the completion of four freedoms plaza the team took up temporary residence at avengers mansion 
pier NUM a waterfront warehouse served as a temporary headquarters after four freedoms plaza was destroyed by the ostensible superhero team the thunderbolts shortly after the revelation that they were actually the supervillain team the masters of evil in disguise 
pier NUM was eventually destroyed during a battle with the longtime fantastic four supervillain diablo after which the team received a new baxter building courtesy of one of team leader reed richards former professors noah baxter 
this second baxter building was constructed in earths orbit and teleported into the vacant lot formerly occupied by the original 
a number of characters are closely affiliated with the team share complex personal histories with one or more of its members but have never actually held an official membership

author christopher knowles states that kirbys work on creations such as the inhumans and the black panther served as a showcase of some of the most radical concepts in the history of the medium
writers and artists over many years have created a variety of characters to challenge the fantastic four 
knowles states that kirby helped to create an army of villains whose rage and destructive power had never been seen before and whose primary impulse is to smash the world 
some of the teams oldest and most frequent enmities have involved such foes as the mole man the skrulls namor the sub-mariner doctor doom the puppet master kang the conquerorrama-tutimmortus blastaar the frightful four annihilus galactus and klaw 
other prominent antagonists of the fantastic four have included the wizard the impossible man the red ghost and the super-apes the mad thinker the super-skrull the molecule man diablo dragon man psycho-man ronan the accuser salems seven terrax the tamer terminus hyperstorm and lucia von bardas 
the fantastic fours characterization was initially different from all other superheroes at the time 
one major difference is that they do not conceal their identities leading the public to be both suspicious and in awe of them 
also they frequently argued and disagreed with each other hindering their work as a team 
described as heroes with hangups by stan lee the thing has a temper and the human torch resents being a child among adults 
mr 
fantastic blames himself for the things transformation 
social scientist bradford w wright describes the team as a volatile mix of human emotions and personalities
in spite of their disagreements they ultimately function well as a team 
the first issue of the fantastic four proved a success igniting a new direction for superhero comics and soon influencing many other superhero comics 
readers grew fond of bens grumpiness johnnys tendency to annoy others and reed and sues spats 
stan lee was surprised at the reaction to the first issue leading him to stay in the comics field despite previous plans to leave

mitchell received the pulitzer prize for fiction for the book in NUM
it was adapted into a NUM american film 
gone with the wind is the only novel by mitchell published during her lifetime 
mitchell used color symbolism especially the colors red and green which frequently are associated with scarlett ohara 
mitchell identified the primary theme as survival 
she left the ending speculative for the reader however 
she was often asked what became of her lovers rhett and scarlett

poem
i have forgot much cynara
gone with the wind
flung roses roses riotously with the throng
dancing to put thy pale lost lilies out of mind ..poem

scarlett ohara uses the title phrase when she wonders to herself if her home on a plantation called tara is still standing or if it had gone with the wind which had swept through georgia 
in a general sense the title is a metaphor for the demise of a way of life in the south prior to the civil war 
when taken in the context of dowsons poem about cynara the phrase gone with the wind alludes to erotic loss

the union refuses to accept secession and no compromise is found as war approaches 
the novel opens april NUM NUM at tara a plantation owned by gerald ohara an irish immigrant who has become a successful planter and his wife ellen robillard ohara from a coastal aristocratic family of french descent 
their NUM-year-old daughter scarlett is not beautiful but men seldom realized it once they were caught up in her charm 
all the talk is of the coming civil war 
there are brief but vivid descriptions of the south as it began and grew with backgrounds of the main characters the stylish and highbrow french the gentlemanly english the forced-to-flee and looked-down-upon irish 
scarlett learns that one of her many beaux ashley wilkes will soon be engaged to his cousin melanie hamilton

rhett refuses to give money to scarlett and leaving the jailhouse in fury she runs into frank kennedy who runs a store in atlanta and is betrothed to scarletts sister suellen

frank succumbs to scarletts charms and marries her two weeks later knowing he has done something romantic and exciting for the first time in his life 
always wanting her to be happy and radiant frank gives scarlett the money to pay the taxes 
while frank has a cold and is pampered by aunt pittypat scarlett goes over the accounts at franks store and finds that many owe him money

she takes control of the store and her business practices leave many atlantans resentful of her

at melanies urging ashley takes the job 
melanie becomes the center of atlanta society and scarlett gives birth to ella lorena ella for her grandmother ellen and lorena because it was the most fashionable name of the day for girls 
georgia is under martial law and life has taken on a new and more frightening tone 
for protection scarlett keeps franks pistol tucked in the upholstery of the buggy 
her trips alone to and from the mill take her past a shantytown where criminal elements live 
while on her way home one evening she is accosted by two men who try to rob her but she escapes with the help of big sam the former negro foreman from tara 
attempting to avenge his wife frank and the ku klux klan raid the shantytown whereupon frank is shot dead

frank kennedy lies in a casket in the quiet stillness of the parlor in aunt pittypats home 
scarlett is remorseful 
she is swigging brandy from aunt pittys swoon bottle when rhett comes to call 
she tells him tearfully im afraid ill die and go to hell 
he says maybe there isnt a hell 
before she can cry any further he asks her to marry him saying i always intended having you one way or another

rhett describes it as an architectural horror
shortly after they move in to their new home the sardonic jabs between them turn into full-blown quarrels 
scarlett wonders why rhett married her 
then with real hate in her eyes she tells rhett she will have a baby which she does not want 
wade is seven years old in NUM when his half-sister eugenie victoria named after two queens is born 
she has blue eyes like gerald ohara and melanie nicknames her bonnie blue in reference to the bonnie blue flag of the confederacy 
when scarlett is feeling well again she makes a trip to the mill and talks to ashley who is alone in the office

ashley tells her how pretty she looks and they reminisce about the days when they were young and talk about their lives now 
suddenly scarletts eyes fill with tears and ashley holds her head against his chest 
ashley sees his sister india wilkes standing in the doorway 
before the party has even begun a rumor of an affair between ashley and scarlett spreads and rhett and melanie hear it 
melanie refuses to accept any criticism of her sister-in-law and india wilkes is banished from the wilkeses home for it causing a rift in the family 
rhett more drunk than scarlett has ever seen him returns home from the party long after scarlett 
his eyes are bloodshot and his mood is dark and violent 
he enjoins scarlett to drink with him 
not wanting him to know she is fearful of him she throws back a drink and gets up from her chair to go back to her bedroom 
he stops her and pins her shoulders to the wall 
she tells him he is jealous of ashley and rhett accuses her of crying for the moon over ashley 
he tells her they could have been happy together saying for i loved you and i know you 
he then takes her in his arms and carries her up the stairs to her bedroom where it is strongly implied that he rapes heror possibly that they have consensual sex following the argument 
the next morning rhett leaves for charleston and new orleans with bonnie 
scarlett finds herself missing him but she is still unsure if rhett loves her having said it while drunk 
she learns she is pregnant with her fourth child 
when rhett returns scarlett waits for him at the top of the stairs 
she wonders if rhett will kiss her but to her irritation he does not 
he says she looks pale 
she says its because she is pregnant 
he sarcastically asks if the father is ashley 
she calls rhett a cad and tells him no woman would want his baby 
he says cheer up maybe youll have a miscarriage 
she lunges at him but he dodges and she tumbles backwards down the stairs 
she is seriously ill for the first time in her life having lost her child and broken her ribs 
rhett is remorseful believing he has killed her 
sobbing and drunk he buries his head in melanies lap and confesses he has been a jealous cad 
scarlett who is thin and pale goes to tara taking wade and ella with her to regain her strength and vitality from the green cotton fields of home 
when she returns healthy to atlanta she sells the mills to ashley 
she finds rhetts attitude has noticeably changed 
he is sober kinder politeand seemingly disinterested 
though she misses the old rhett at times scarlett is content to leave well enough alone 
bonnie is four years old in NUM
spirited and willful she has her father wrapped around her finger and giving in to her every demand 
even scarlett is jealous of the attention bonnie gets 
rhett rides his horse around town with bonnie in front of him but mammy insists it is not fitting for a girl to ride a horse with her dress flying up 
rhett heeds her words and buys bonnie a shetland pony whom she names mr butler and teaches her to ride sidesaddle 
then rhett pays a boy named wash twenty-five cents to teach mr butler to jump over wood bars 
when mr butler is able to get his fat legs over a one-foot bar rhett puts bonnie on the pony and soon mr butler is leaping bars and aunt mellys rose bushes 
wearing her blue velvet riding habit with a red feather in her black hat bonnie pleads with her father to raise the bar to one and a half feet 
he gives in warning her not to come crying if she falls 
bonnie yells to her mother watch me take this one
the pony gallops towards the wood bar but trips over it 
bonnie breaks her neck in the fall and dies 
in the dark days and months following bonnies death rhett is often drunk and disheveled while scarlett though deeply bereaved also seems to hold up under the strain 
with the untimely death of melanie wilkes a short time later rhett decides he only wants the calm dignity of the genial south he once knew in his youth and leaves atlanta to find it 
meanwhile scarlett dreams of love that has eluded her for so long 
however she still has tara and knows she can win rhett back because tomorrow is another day 
margaret mitchell arranged gone with the wind chronologically basing it on the life and experiences of the main character scarlett ohara as she grew from adolescence into adulthood 
during the time span of the novel from NUM to NUM scarlett ages from sixteen to twenty-eight years 
this is a type of bildungsroman a novel concerned with the moral and psychological growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood coming-of-age story
scarletts development is affected by the events of her time 
mitchell used a smooth linear narrative structure 
the novel is known for its exceptional readability
the plot is rich with vivid characters 
gone with the wind is often placed in the literary subgenre of the historical romance novel 
pamela regis has argued that is more appropriately classified as a historical novel as it does not contain all of the elements of the romance genre 
the novel has also been described as an early classic of the erotic historical genre because it is thought to contain some degree of pornography 
slavery in gone with the wind is a backdrop to a story that is essentially about other things 
southern plantation fiction also known as anti-tom literature in reference to reactions to harriet beecher stowes anti-slavery novel uncle toms cabin of NUM from the mid-NUMth century culminating in gone with the wind is written from the perspective and values of the slaveholder and tends to present slaves as docile and happy 
the characters in the novel are organized into two basic groups along class lines the white planter class such as scarlett and ashley and the black house servant class 
the slaves depicted in gone with the wind are primarily loyal house servants such as mammy pork prissy and uncle peter 
house servants are the highest caste of slaves in mitchells caste system 
they choose to stay with their masters after the emancipation proclamation of NUM and subsequent thirteenth amendment of NUM sets them free 
of the servants who stayed at tara scarlett thinks there were qualities of loyalty and tirelessness and love in them that no strain could break no money could buy 
the field slaves make up the lower class in mitchells caste system 
the field slaves from the tara plantation and the foreman big sam are taken away by confederate soldiers to dig ditches and never return to the plantation 
mitchell wrote that other field slaves were loyal and refused to avail themselves of the new freedom but the novel has no field slaves who stay on the plantation to work after they have been emancipated 
american william wells brown escaped from slavery and published his memoir or slave narrative in NUM
he wrote of the disparity in conditions between the house servant and the field hand

during the time that mr cook was overseer i was a house servanta situation preferable to a field hand as i was better fed better clothed and not obliged to rise at the ringing bell but about an half hour after 
i have often laid and heard the crack of the whip and the screams of the slave 
although the novel is more than NUM pages long the character of mammy never considers what her life might be like away from tara 
she recognizes her freedom to come and go as she pleases saying ah is free miss scarlett 
you kain sen me nowhar ah doan wanter go but mammy remains duty-bound to miss ellens chile 
no other name for mammy is noted in the novel 
eighteen years before the publication of gone with the wind an article titled the old black mammy written in the confederate veteran in NUM discussed the romanticized view of the mammy character that had persisted in southern literature

...for her faithfulness and devotion she has been immortalized in the literature of the south so the memory of her will never pass but live on in the tales that are told of those dear dead days beyond recall
micki mcelya in her book clinging to mammy suggests the myth of the faithful slave in the figure of mammy lingered because white americans wished to live in a world in which african americans were not angry over the injustice of slavery 
the best-selling anti-slavery novel from the NUMth century is uncle toms cabin by harriet beecher stowe published in NUM
uncle toms cabin is mentioned briefly in gone with the wind as being accepted by the yankees as revelation second only to the bible
the enduring interest of both uncle toms cabin and gone with the wind has resulted in lingering stereotypes of NUMth-century african-american slaves 
gone with the wind has become a reference point for subsequent writers about the south both black and white alike 
the southern belle is an archetype for a young woman of the antebellum american south upper class 
the southern belle was believed to be physically attractive but more importantly personally charming with sophisticated social skills 
she is subject to the correct code of female behavior 
the novels heroine scarlett ohara charming though not beautiful is a classic southern belle 
for young scarlett the ideal southern belle is represented by her mother ellen ohara 
in a study in scarlett published in the new yorker claudia roth pierpont wrote

the southern belle was bred to conform to a subspecies of the nineteenth-century lady... for scarlett the ideal is embodied in her adored mother the saintly ellen whose back is never seen to rest against the back of any chair on which she sits whose broken spirit everywhere is mistaken for righteous calm .
however scarlett is not always willing to conform 
kathryn lee seidel in her book the southern belle in the american novel wrote

...part of her does try to rebel against the restraints of a code of behavior that relentlessly attempts to mold her into a form to which she is not naturally suited 
the figure of a pampered southern belle scarlett lives through an extreme reversal of fortune and wealth and survives to rebuild tara and her self-esteem 
her bad belle traits scarletts deceitfulness shrewdness manipulation and superficiality in contrast to melanies good belle traits trust self-sacrifice and loyalty enable her to survive in the post-war south and pursue her main interest which is to make enough money to survive and prosper 
although scarlett was born around NUM she is portrayed to appeal to modern-day readers for her passionate and independent spirit determination and obstinate refusal to feel defeated 
marriage was supposed to be the goal of all southern belles as womens status was largely determined by that of their husbands 
all social and educational pursuits were directed towards it 
despite the civil war and loss of a generation of eligible men young ladies were still expected to marry 
by law and southern social convention household heads were adult white propertied males and all white women and all african americans were thought to require protection and guidance because they lacked the capacity for reason and self-control 
the atlanta historical society has produced a number of gone with the wind exhibits among them a NUM exhibit titled disputed territories gone with the wind and southern myths
the exhibit asked was scarlett a lady
 finding that historically most women of the period were not involved in business activities as scarlett was during reconstruction when she ran a sawmill 
white women performed traditional jobs such as teaching and sewing and generally disliked work outside the home 
during the civil war southern women played a major role as volunteer nurses working in makeshift hospitals 
many were middle- and upper class women who had never worked for wages or seen the inside of a hospital 
one such nurse was ada w bacot a young widow who had lost two children 
bacot came from a wealthy south carolina plantation family that owned NUM slaves 
in the fall of NUM confederate laws were changed to permit women to be employed in hospitals as members of the confederate medical department 
twenty-seven-year-old nurse kate cumming from mobile alabama described the primitive hospital conditions in her journal

they are in the hall on the gallery and crowded into very small rooms 
the foul air from this mass of human beings at first made me giddy and sick but i soon got over it 
we have to walk and when we give the men any thing kneel in blood and water but we think nothing of it at all 
the civil war came to an end on april NUM NUM when confederate general johnston surrendered his armies in the carolinas campaign to union general sherman 
several battles are mentioned or depicted in gone with the wind
the atlanta campaign mayseptember NUM took place in northwest georgia and the area around atlanta 
confederate general johnston fights and retreats from dalton may NUM to resaca may NUM to kennesaw mountain june NUM
union general sherman suffers heavy losses to the entrenched confederate army 
unable to pass through kennesaw sherman swings his men around to the chattahoochee river where the confederate army is waiting on the opposite side of the river 
once again general sherman flanks the confederate army forcing johnston to retreat to peachtree creek july NUM five miles northeast of atlanta 
the savannah campaign was conducted in georgia during november and december NUM
although abraham lincoln is mentioned in the novel fourteen times no reference is made to his assassination on april NUM NUM
ashley wilkes is the beau ideal of southern manhood 
a planter by inheritance ashley knew the confederate cause had died at the conclusion of the american civil war 
ashleys name signifies paleness 
his pallid skin literalizes the idea of confederate death 
he contemplates leaving georgia for new york city 
had he gone north he would have joined numerous other confederate carpetbaggers there 
ashley embittered by war tells scarlett he has been in a state of suspended animation since the surrender 
he feels he is not shouldering a mans burden at tara and believes he is much less than a manmuch less indeed than a woman
a young girls dream of the perfect knight ashley is like a young girl himself 
with his poets eye ashley has a feminine sensitivity
scarlett is angered by the slur of effeminacy flung at ashley when her father tells her the wilkes family was born queer
mitchells use of the word queer is for its sexual connotation because queer in the NUMs was associated with homosexuality 
ashleys effeminacy is associated with his appearance his lack of forcefulness and sexual impotency 
he rides plays poker and drinks like proper men but his heart is not in it gerald claims 
the embodiment of castration ashley wears the head of medusa on his cravat pin 
scarletts love interest ashley wilkes lacks manliness and her husbandsthe calf-like charles hamilton and the old-maid in britches frank kennedyare unmanly as well 
mitchell is critiquing masculinity in southern society since reconstruction 
even rhett butler the well-groomed dandy is effeminate or gay-coded 
charles frank and ashley represent the impotence of the post-war white south 
its power and influence have been diminished 
the word scallawag is defined as a loafer a vagabond or a rogue 
scallawag had a special meaning after the civil war as an epithet for a white southerner who accepted and supported republican reforms 
mitchell defines scallawags as southerners who had turned republican very profitably 
rhett butler is accused of being a damned scallawag 
in addition to scallawags mitchell portrays other types of scoundrels in the novel yankees carpetbaggers republicans prostitutes and overseers 
in the early years of the civil war rhett is called a scoundrel for his selfish gains profiteering as a blockade-runner 
as a scallawag rhett is despised 
he is the dark mysterious and slightly malevolent hero loose in the world
literary scholars have identified elements of mitchells first husband berrien red upshaw in the character of rhett 
another sees the image of italian actor rudolph valentino whom margaret mitchell interviewed as a young reporter for the atlanta journal
fictional hero rhett butler has a swarthy face flashing teeth and dark alert eyes
he is a scamp blackguard without scruple or honor 
if gone with the wind has a theme it is that of survival 
what makes some people come through catastrophes and others apparently just as able strong and brave go under
it happens in every upheaval 
some people survive others dont 
what qualities are in those who fight their way through triumphantly that are lacking in those that go under
i only know that survivors used to call that quality gumption 
so i wrote about people who had gumption and people who didnt 
margaret mitchell NUM

mitchells use of color in the novel is symbolic and open to interpretation 
red green and a variety of hues of each of these colors are the predominant palette of colors related to scarlett 
she is also linked to white by the color of her skin 
symbolically red and green have been broadly defined to mean vitality red and rebirth green
mitchell interwove the two colors into her description of the tara plantation red fields with springing green cotton
the red fields are blood-colored after rains
the whitewashed brick plantation house is virtually nondescript by comparison to the plantation fields and sits like an island in a sea of red 
in springtime the lawn around the plantation house turns emerald green 
for the irish and others green in the novel represents mitchells commemoration of her green irish heritage 
gerald ohara pridefully sings the wearin o the green
scarletts green-coded irish identity is the strength that ensures she will thrive post-war 
rhett likens scarletts strength to the mythological figure antaeus who stays strong only when he is in contact with his mother earth 
scarletts mythical mother is tara 
scarlett is not all green her name suggests the erotically-charged color red 
the only openly scarlet woman in the novel is the red-headed belle watling whose hair is too red to be true
mammy is reluctant to reveal her red petticoat to rhett nevertheless she has sexual knowledge akin to belle watling 
scarlett whom mitchell pits against the war prostitutes herself to pay the taxes on tara 
by her name scarlett evokes emotions and images of the color scarlet blood passion anger sexuality madness
the sales of margaret mitchells novel in the summer of NUM as the nation was recovering from the great depression and at the virtually unprecedented high price of three dollars reached about one million by the end of december 
the book was a bestseller by the time reviews began to appear in national magazines 
herschel brickell a critic for the new york evening post lauded mitchell for the way she tosses out the window all the thousands of technical tricks our novelists have been playing with for the past twenty years 
ralph thompson a book reviewer for the new york times was critical of the length of the novel and wrote in june NUM

i happen to feel that the book would have been infinitely better had it been edited down to say NUM pages but there speaks the harassed daily reviewer as well as the would-be judicious critic 
very nearly every reader will agree no doubt that a more disciplined and less prodigal piece of work would have more nearly done justice to the subject-matter 
gone with the wind has been criticized for its stereotypical and derogatory portrayal of african americans in the NUMth century south 
former field hands during the early days of reconstruction are described behaving as creatures of small intelligence might naturally be expected to do 
like monkeys or small children turned loose among treasured objects whose value is beyond their comprehension they ran wildeither from perverse pleasure in destruction or simply because of their ignorance 
commenting on this passage of the novel jabari asim author of the n word who can say it who shouldnt and why says it is one of the more charitable passages in gone with the wind margaret mitchell hesitated to blame black insolence during reconstruction solely on mean niggers of which she said there were few even in slavery days 
critics say that mitchell downplayed the violent role of the ku klux klan and their abuse of freedmen 
author pat conroy in his preface to a later edition of the novel describes mitchells portrayal of the ku klux klan as having the same romanticized role it had in the birth of a nation and appears to be a benign combination of the elks club and a mens equestrian society
regarding the historical inaccuracies of the novel historian richard n current points out

no doubt it is indeed unfortunate that gone with the wind perpetuates many myths about reconstruction particularly with respect to blacks 
margaret mitchell did not originate them and a young novelist can scarcely be faulted for not knowing what the majority of mature professional historians did not know until many years later 
in gone with the wind mitchell explores some complexities in racial issues 
scarlett was asked by a yankee woman for advice on who to appoint as a nurse for her children scarlett suggested a darky much to the disgust of the yankee woman who was seeking an irish maid a bridget
african americans and irish americans are treated in precisely the same way in gone with the wind writes david oconnell in his NUM book the irish roots of margaret mitchells gone with the wind
ethnic slurs on the irish and irish stereotypes pervade the novel oconnell claims and scarlett is not an exception to the terminology 
irish scholar geraldine higgins notes that jonas wilkerson labels scarlett you highflying bogtrotting irish
higgins says that as the irish american oharas were slaveholders and african americans were held in bondage the two ethnic groups are not equivalent in the ethnic hierarchy of the novel 
the novel has been criticized for promoting plantation values 
mitchell biographer marianne walker author of margaret mitchell and john marsh the love story behind gone with the wind believes that those who attack the book on these grounds have not read it 
she said that the popular NUM film promotes a false notion of the old south
mitchell was not involved in the screenplay or film production 
james loewen author of lies my teacher told me everything your american history textbook got wrong says this novel is profoundly racist and profoundly wrong 
in NUM an alderman in waukegan illinois challenged the books inclusion on the reading list of the waukegan school district on the grounds of racism and unacceptable language 
he objected to the frequent use of the racial slur nigger 
he also objected to several other books the nigger of the narcissus uncle toms cabin and adventures of huckleberry finn for the same reason 
in NUM margaret mitchell received the pulitzer prize for fiction for gone with the wind and the second annual national book award from the american booksellers association

the windies are ardent gone with the wind fans who follow all the latest news and events surrounding the book and film 
they gather periodically in costumes from the film or dressed as margaret mitchell 
atlanta georgia is their mecca 
one story of the legacy of gone with the wind is that people worldwide incorrectly think it was the true story of the old south and how it was changed by the american civil war and reconstruction 
the film adaptation of the novel amplified this effect 
the plantation legend was burned into the mind of the public through mitchells vivid prose 
moreover her fictional account of the war and its aftermath has influenced how the world has viewed the city of atlanta for successive generations 
some readers of the novel have seen the film first and read the novel afterward 
one difference between the film and the novel is the staircase scene in which rhett carries scarlett up the stairs 
in the film scarlett weakly struggles and does not scream as rhett starts up the stairs 
in the novel he hurt her and she cried out muffled frightened

this list is a starting point 
it is not a register of the best american books  although many of them fit that description 
rather the list is intended to spark a national conversation on books written by americans that have influenced our lives whether they appear on this initial list or not 
among books on the list considered to be the great american novel were moby-dick adventures of huckleberry finn the great gatsby the grapes of wrath the catcher in the rye invisible man and to kill a mockingbird
throughout the world the novel appeals due to its universal themes war love death racial conflict class gender and generation which speak especially to women 
in north korea readers relate to the novels theme of survival finding it to be the most compelling message of the novel
margaret mitchells personal collection of nearly NUM foreign language translations of her novel was given to the atlanta public library after her death 
on august NUM NUM the archdiocese of atlanta announced that it had been bequeathed a NUM stake in the trademarks and literary rights to gone with the wind from the estate of margaret mitchells deceased nephew joseph mitchell

herman melville

herman melville august NUM NUM september NUM NUM was an american novelist short story writer and poet of the american renaissance period 
his best known works include typee NUM a romantic account of his experiences in polynesian life and his whaling novel moby-dick NUM
his work was almost forgotten during his last NUM years 
melville was born in new york city the third child of a merchant in french dry goods and his wife 
his formal education ended abruptly after his father died in NUM as this left the family in financial straits 
he briefly became a schoolteacher before he took to sea in NUM as a sailor on a merchant ship 
in NUM he signed aboard the whaler acushnet for his first whaling voyage but jumped ship in the marquesas islands 
he returned to boston in NUM after further adventures 
his first book was typee NUM a highly romanticized account of his life among polynesians 
it became such a best-seller that he wrote the sequel omoo NUM
these successes gave him the financial basis to marry elizabeth shaw daughter of a prominent boston family but the success proved hard to sustain 
his first novel that was not based on his own experiences was mardi NUM a sea narrative that develops into a philosophical allegorybut it was not well received 
he received warmer reviews for redburn NUM a story of life on a merchant ship and his NUM description of the harsh life aboard a man-of-war in white-jacket but they did not provide financial security 
in august NUM melville moved his growing family to arrowhead a farm in pittsfield massachusetts where he established a profound but short-lived friendship with nathaniel hawthorne to whom he dedicated moby-dick
this novel was another commercial failure published to mixed reviews 
melvilles career as a popular author effectively ended with the cool reception of  NUM in part a satirical portrait of the literary culture at the time 
his revolutionary war novel israel potter appeared in NUM
from NUM to NUM melville published short fiction in magazines most notably bartleby the scrivener NUM the encantadas NUM and benito cereno NUM
these and three other stories were collected in NUM as the piazza tales
in NUM he traveled to england where he reunited with hawthorne for the first time since NUM and then toured the near east 
the confidence-man NUM was the last prose work that he published 
he moved to new york to take a position as customs inspector and turned to poetry 
battle-pieces and aspects of the war NUM was his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the american civil war 
in NUM his oldest child malcolm died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot 
was published in NUM a metaphysical epic 
in NUM his son stanwix died and melville retired 
during his last years he privately published two volumes of poetry left one volume unpublished and returned to prose of the sea 
the novella billy budd was left unfinished at his death but was published in NUM
melvilles death from cardiovascular disease in NUM subdued a reviving interest in his work 
the NUM centennial of his birth became the starting point of the melville revival 
critics discovered his work scholars explored his life his major novels and stories have come to be considered world classics and his poetry has gradually gained respect 
born herman melvill in new york city on august NUM NUM to allan melvill NUM and maria gansevoort melvill NUM herman was the third of eight children 
his siblings who played important roles in his career as well as in his emotional life were gansevoort NUM helen maria NUM augusta NUM allan NUM catherine NUM frances priscilla NUM and thomas NUM who eventually became a governor of sailors snug harbor 
part of a well-established and colorful boston family melvilles father spent much time out of new york and in europe as a commission merchant and an importer of french dry goods 
both of melvilles grandfathers were heroes of the revolutionary war 
major thomas melvill NUM had taken part in the boston tea party and his maternal grandfather general peter gansevoort NUM was famous for having commanded the defense of fort stanwix in new york in NUM
melville found satisfaction in his double revolutionary descent 
major melvill sent his son allan hermans father not to college but to france at the turn of the nineteenth century where he spent two years in paris and learned to speak and write french fluently 
he subscribed to his fathers unitarianism 
in NUM allan married maria gansevoor who was committed to the dutch reformed version of the calvinist creed of her family 
the severe protestantism of the gansevoorts tradition ensured that she knew her bible well in english as well as in dutch the language she had grown up speaking with her parents 
almost three weeks after his birth on august NUM herman melville was baptized at home by a minister of the south reformed dutch church 
during the NUMs melville lived a privileged opulent life in a household with three or more servants at a time 
at four-year intervals the family would move to more spacious and elegant quarters finally settling on broadway in NUM
allan melvill lived beyond his means and on large sums he borrowed from both his father and his wifes widowed mother 
his wifes opinion of his financial conduct is unknown 
biographer hershel parker suggests maria thought her mothers money was infinite and that she was entitled to much of her portion now while she had small children 
how well biographer delbanco adds the parents managed to hide the truth from their children is impossible to kno 
in NUM marias family finally lost patience and their support came to a halt at which point allans total debt to both families exceeded NUM
the felicity of melvilles early childhood biographer newton arvin writes depended not so much on wealth as on the exceptionally tender and affectionate spirit in all the family relationships especially in the immediate circle 
arvin describes allan as a man of real sensibility and a particularly warm and loving father while maria was warmly maternal simple robust and affectionately devoted to her husband and her brood 
melvilles education began when he was five around the time the melvills moved to a newly built house at NUM bleecker street 
in NUM the same year that melville contracted scarlet fever allan melvill who sent both gansevoort and herman to the new york male high school described melville in a letter to peter gansevoort jr as very backwards in speech  somewhat slow in comprehension 
his older brother gansevoort appeared to be the brightest of the children but soon melvilles development increased its pace 
you will be as much surprised as myself to know allan wrote peter gansevoort jr  that herman proved the best speaker in the introductory department at the examination of the high school he has made rapid progress during the NUM last quarters 
in NUM both gansevoort and herman were transferred to columbia grammar  preparatory school and herman enrolled in the english department on NUM september 
herman i think is making more progress than formerly allan wrote in may NUM to major melvill  without being a bright scholar he maintains a respectable standing  would proceed further if he could only be induced to study morebeing a most amiable  innocent child i cannot find it in my heart to coerce him 
emotionally unstable and behind on paying the rent for the house on broadway the father allan tried to recover from his setbacks by moving his family to albany in NUM and going into the fur business 
herman attended the albany academy from october NUM to october NUM where he took the standard preparatory course studying reading and spelling penmanship arithmetic english grammar geography natural history universal greek roman and english history classical biography and jewish antiquities 
it is unknown why he left the academy in october NUM parker suggests that by then even the tiny tuition fee seemed too much to pay 
his brothers gansevoort and allan continued their attendance a few months longer gansevoort until march the next year 
the ubiquitous classical references in melvilles published writings as melville scholar merton sealts observed suggest that his study of ancient history biography and literature during his school days left a lasting impression on both his thought and his art as did his almost encyclopedic knowledge of both the old and the new testaments 
in december melvilles father returned from new york city by steamboat but ice forced him to travel the last seventy miles for two days and two nights in an open horse carriage at two degrees below zero fahrenheit with the result that he developed a cold 
in early january he began to show signs of delirium and his situation grew worse until hein the words of his wifeby reason of severe suffering was deprived of his intellect 
two months before reaching fifty allan melvill died on NUM january NUM
as melville was no longer attending school he must have witnessed these scenes twenty years later he described such a death in the death of pierres father in pierre
one result of his fathers early death was that the religious creed of his mother exerted more influence 
melvilles saturation in orthodox calvinism is for arvin surely the most decisive intellectual and spiritual influence of his early life 
two months after his fathers death gansevoort entered the cap and fur business 
maria sought consolation in her faith and in april was admitted as a member of the first reformed dutch church 
uncle peter gansevoort who was one of the directors of the new york state bank got herman a job as clerk for NUM a year 
what he thought of all the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing redburn i had learned to think much and bitterly before my time the narrator remarks adding i must not think of those delightful days before my father became a bankrupt .. and we removed from the city for when i think of those days something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me 
according to arvins influential suggestion with melville one has to reckon with the tormented psychology of the decayed patrician 
when melvilles paternal grandfather died on september NUM NUM it emerged that allan had borrowed more than his share of the inheritance and maria melville consequently received only NUM
the grandmother died on april NUM NUM
melville did his job well at the bank though he was only fourteen in NUM the bank considered him competent enough to be sent to schenectady on an errand 
not much else is known from this period except that he was very fond of drawing 
the visual arts became a lifelong interest 
around may NUM the melvilles moved to another house in albany a three-story brick house 
that same month a fire destroyed gansevoorts skin-preparing factory which left him with personnel he could neither employ nor afford 
instead he pulled melville out of the bank to man the cap and fur store 
biographer andrew delbanco says that gansevoort was doing so well he could hire his younger brother until a fire broke out in NUM destroying both factory and the store 
in any case older brother gansevoort served as a role model for melville in various ways 
in early NUM gansevoort had become a member of the albanys young mens association for mutual improvement and in january NUM melville became a member as well 
in NUM while still working in the store melville enrolled in albany classical school perhaps using marias part of the proceeds from the sale of the estate of his maternal grandmother in march NUM
in september of the following year herman was back in albany academy in the latin course 
he also joined debating societies in an apparent effort to make up as much as he could for his missed years of schooling 
in this period he also became acquainted with shakespeares macbeth at least and teased his sisters with a passage from the witch scenes 
in march NUM he was again withdrawn from albany academy 
gansevoort had copies of john todds index rerum a blank book more of a register in which one could index remarkable passages from books one had read for easy retrieval 
among the sample entries was pequot beautiful description of the war with with a short title reference to the place in benjamin trumbulls a complete history of connecticut NUM or NUM where the description could be found 
the two surviving volumes are the best evidence for melvilles reading in this period because there is little doubt that gansevoorts reading served him as a guide 
the entries include books that melville later used for moby-dick and clarel such as parseesof indiaan excellent description of their character  religion  an account of their descenteast india sketch book p 
NUM.
other entries are on panther the pirates cabin and storm at sea from james fenimore coopers the red rover saint-saba 
in april NUM a nationwide economic panic forced gansevoort to file for bankruptcy and uncle thomas jr secretly planned to leave pittsfield where he had not paid taxes on the farm 
on june NUM maria informed the younger children that the family had to move to some village where the rent was cheaper than in albany 
gansevoort became a law student in new york city and herman managed the farm while his uncle settled in galena illinois 
that summer melville decided to become a schoolteacher 
he got a position at sikes district school near lenox massachusetts where he taught some thirty students of various ages including his own 
his term over he returned to his mother in NUM
in february he was elected president of the philo logos society which peter gansevoort invited to move into stanwix hall for no rent 
many chambers were vacant as a result of the economic crisis 
in march melville published in the albany microscope two polemical letters about issues in the debating societies he was engaged in it is not entirely clear what the polemic was about 
biographers leon howard and hershel parker suggest that the real issue was the youthful desire to exercise his rhetoric skills in public and his first appearance in print would have been an exciting experience for any young man 
in may the melvilles moved to lansingburgh almost NUM miles north of albany into a rented house on the east side of the river in what is now troy at NUMst avenue and NUMth street 
the familys retreat was now complete from the metropolis to a provincial city to a village 
what melville did after his term at sikes ended until november or if he even had a job after that remains a mystery 
apparently he courted a local lansingburgh girl sometime during the summer but nothing else is known 
on NUM november melville arrived in lansingburgh 
where he had come from is unknown 
five days later he paid for a term at lansingburgh academy where he took a course in surveying and engineering 
in april NUM peter gansevoort wrote a letter to recommend herman for a job in the engineer department of the erie canal saying that his nephew possesses the ambition to make himself useful in a business which he desires to make his profession but no job resulted 
melvilles first known published essay came only weeks after he failed to find a job as an engineer 
using the unexplained initials la v  herman contributed fragments from a writing desk to the democratic press and lansingburgh advertiser a weekly newspaper which printed the piece in two installments the first on NUM may 
according to scholar sealts the heavy-handed allusions reveal his early familiarity with the writings of william shakespeare john milton walter scott richard brinsley sheridan edmund burke samuel taylor coleridge lord byron and thomas moore which gansevoort had kept around the house 
biographer parker calls the piece characteristic melvillean mood-stuff and considers its prose style excessive enough to allow him to indulge his extravagances and just enough overdone to allow him to deny that he was taking his style seriously 
biographer delbanco finds the prose overheated in the manner of poe with sexually charged echoes of byron and the arabian nights 
on may NUM NUM gansevoort then living in new york city wrote that he was sure herman could get a job on a whaler or merchant vessel 
the next day he signed aboard the merchant ship st lawrence as a boy a green hand which cruised from new york to liverpool he arrived back in new york october NUM
redburn his first voyage NUM draws on his experiences in this journey 
melville resumed teaching now at greenbush new york but left after one term because he had not been paid 
in the summer of NUM he and his friend james murdock fly went to galena illinois to see if his uncle thomas could help them find work 
on this trip it is possible that herman went up the mississippi where he may well have witnessed scenes of frontier life he later used in his books 
unsuccessful he and his friend returned home in autumn very likely by way of st louis and up the ohio river 
probably inspired by his reading of richard henry dana jr s new book two years before the mast and by jeremiah n reynoldss account in the may NUM issue of the knickerbocker magazine of the hunt for a great white sperm whale named mocha dick melville and gansevoort traveled to new bedford where melville signed up for a whaling voyage aboard a new ship the acushnet
built in NUM the ship measured some NUM feet in length almost NUM feet in breadth and almost NUM feet in depth 
she measured slightly less than NUM tons had two decks and three masts but no galleries 
melville signed a contract on christmas day with the ships agent as a green hand for NUMth of whatever profits the voyage would yield 
on sunday the NUMth the brothers heard the reverend enoch mudge preach at the seamens bethel on johnny-cake hill where white marble cenotaphs on the walls memorialized local sailors who had died at sea often in battle with whales 
when he signed the crew list the next day he was advanced NUM
on january NUM NUM the acushnet set sail 
melville slept with some twenty others in the forecastle captain valentine pease the mates and the skilled men slept aft 
whales were found near the bahamas and in march NUM barrels of oil were sent home from rio de janeiro 
cutting in and trying-out boiling a single whale took some three days and a whale yielded approximately one barrel of oil per foot of length and per ton of weight the average whale weighed NUM to NUM tons
the oil was kept on deck for a day to cool off and was then stowed down scrubbing the deck completed the labor 
an average voyage meant that some forty whales were killed to yield some NUM barrels of oil 
on NUM april the acushnet sailed around cape horn and traveled to the south pacific where the crew sighted whales without catching any 
then up the coast of chile to the region of selkirk island and on NUM may near juan fernndez islands she had NUM barrels 
on NUM june the ship anchored for the first time since rio in santa harbor 
the cruising grounds the acushnet was sailing attracted much traffic and captain pease not only paused to visit other whalers but at times hunted in company with them 
from NUM july into august the acushnet regularly gammed with the lima from nantucket and melville met william henry chase the son of owen chase who gave him a copy of his fathers account of his adventures aboard the essex
ten years later melville wrote in his other copy of the book the reading of this wondrous story upon the landless sea  close to the very latitude of the shipwreck had a surprising effect upon me 
on NUM september the ship reported NUM barrels of oil to another whaler and in october NUM barrels 
on NUM october the acushnet crossed the equator to the north and six or seven days later arrived at the galpagos islands 
this short visit would be the basis for the encantadas
on NUM november the acushnet and three other american whalers were hunting together near the galpagos islands melville later exaggerated that number in sketch fourth of the encantadas
from NUM to NUM november the ship anchored at chathams isle and on NUM december reached the coast of peru and anchored at tombez near paita with NUM barrels of oil on board 
on NUM december the acushnet sighted cape blanco off ecuador point st elena was sighted the next day and on NUM january NUM the ship approached the galpagos islands from the southeast 
from NUM february to NUM may seven sightings of sperm whales were recorded but none killed 
from early may to early june the acushnet gammed several times with the columbus of new bedford which also took letters from melvilles ship the two ships were in the same area just south of the equator 
on NUM june she carried NUM barrels and sent home NUM on the herald the second
on NUM june the acushnet reached the marquesas islands and anchored at nuku hiva 
on NUM july NUM melville and his shipmate richard tobias greene jumped ship at nukahiva bay and ventured into the mountains to avoid capture 
melvilles first book typee NUM is loosely based on his stay in or near the taipi valley 
scholarly research starting in the NUMs and extending into the twenty-first century has increasingly shown that much if not all of this account was either taken from melvilles readings or exaggerated to dramatize a contrast between idyllic native culture and western civilization 
on august NUM melville boarded the lucy ann bound for tahiti where he took part in a mutiny and was briefly jailed in the native calabooza beretanee
in october he and crew mate john b 
troy escaped tahiti for eimeo 
he then spent a month as beachcomber and island rover omoo in tahitian eventually crossing over to moorea 
he drew on these experiences for omoo the sequel to typee in november he signed articles on the nantucket whaler charles  henry for a six-month cruise november NUM april NUM and was discharged at lahaina maui in the hawaiian islands in may NUM
after four months of working several jobs including as a clerk he joined the us navy initially as one of the crew of the frigate as an ordinary seaman on august NUM
during the next year the homeward bound ship visited the marquesas islands tahiti and valparaiso and then from summer to fall NUM mazatlan lima and rio de janeiro before reaching boston on october NUM
melville was discharged on october NUM
this navy experience is used in white-jacket NUM melvilles fifth book 
melvilles wander-years created what biographer arvin calls a settled hatred of external authority a lust for personal freedom and a growing and intensifying sense of his own exceptionalness as a person along with the resentful sense that circumstance and mankind together had already imposed their will upon him in a series of injurious ways 
scholar milder believes the encounter with the wide ocean where he was seemingly abandoned by god led melville to experience a metaphysical estrangement and influenced his social views in two ways first that he belonged to the genteel classes but sympathized with the disinherited commons he had been placed among second that experiencing the cultures of polynesia let him view the west from an outsiders perspective 
upon his return melville regaled his family and friends with his adventurous tales and romantic experiences and they urged him to put them into writing 
melville completed typee his first book in the summer of NUM while living in troy 
his brother gansevoort found a publisher for it in london where it was published in february NUM by john murray and became an overnight bestseller then in new york on march NUM by wiley  putnam 
inspired by his adventures in the marquesas the book was far from a reliable autobiographical account 
melville extended the period his narrator spent on the island to three months more than he himself did made it appear that he understood the native language and incorporated material from source books he had assembled 
scholar robert milder calls typee an appealing mixture of adventure anecdote ethnography and social criticism presented with a genial latitudinarianism that gave novelty to a south sea idyll at once erotically suggestive and romantically chaste 
an unsigned review in the salem advertiser actually written by nathaniel hawthorne called the book a skilfully managed narrative lightly but vigorously written by an author with that freedom of view .. which renders him tolerant of codes of morals that may be little in accordance with our own 
the depictions of the native girls are voluptuously colored yet not more so than the exigencies of the subject appear to require 
pleased but slightly bemused by the adulation of his new public melville later complained in a letter to nathaniel hawthorne that he would go down to posterity  .. as a man who lived among the cannibals
some readers found it unbelievable however 
the book brought melville into contact with his friend greene again toby in the book who wrote to the newspapers confirming melvilles account 
the two corresponded until NUM and sustained a bond for life in his final years melville traced and successfully located his old friend 
in march NUM omoo a sequel to typee was published by murray in london and in may by harper in new york 
omoo is a slighter but more professional book according to milder 
typee and omoo gave melville overnight renown as a writer and adventurer and he often entertained by telling stories to his admirers 
as the writer and editor nathaniel parker willis wrote with his cigar and his spanish eyes he talks typee and omoo just as you find the flow of his delightful mind on paper 
in NUM melville tried unsuccessfully to find a government job in washington 
in june NUM melville and elizabeth knapp shaw were engaged after knowing each other for approximately three months 
a brief courtship yet melville had already asked her father for her hand in march but was turned down 
lizzies father was lemuel shaw the chief justice of the massachusetts supreme judicial court 
arvin describes lemuel shaw as a man of an almost childlike tenderness of heart and gentleness of feeling 
he had been an intimate friend of melvilles father and had fallen in love with allens sister nancy 
he would have married her had she not died early 
his grief was such that for many years he did not marry and his friendship with the melvilles continued after allens death 
his wife elizabeth died when she gave birth to their first daughter who was named elizabeth in remembrance of her mother 
elizabeth was raised by her grandmother and the irish nurse 
arvin suggests that melvilles interest in elizabeth may have been stimulated by his need of judge shaws paternal presence 
they were married on august NUM NUM
as lizzie wrote a relative my marriage was very unexpected and scarcely thought of until about two months before it actually took place 
she wanted to be married in church but we all thought if it were to get about previously that typee was to be seen on such a day a great crowd might rush out of mere curiosity to see the author who would have no personal interest in us whatsoever and make it very unpleasant for us both 
because of melvilles celebrity status a private wedding ceremony took place at home 
the couple honeymooned in canada and traveled to montreal 
they settled in a house on fourth avenue in new york city 
according to scholars joyce deveau kennedy and frederick james kennedy lizzie brought the following qualities to their marriage a sense of religious obligation in marriage an intent to make a home with melville regardless of place a willingness to please her husband by performing such tasks of drudgery as mending stockings an ability to hide her agitation and a desire to shield melville from unpleasantness 
the kennedys conclude their assessment with

biographer robertson-lorants cites lizzies adventurous spirit and abundant energy and she suggests that her pluck and good humor might have been what attracted melville to her and vice versa 
an example of such good humor appears in a letter about her not yet used to being married it seems sometimes exactly as if i were here for a visit
the illusion is quite dispelled however when herman stalks into my room without even the ceremony of knocking bringing me perhaps a button to sew on or some equally romantic occupation 
in march NUM mardi was published by richard bentley in london and in april by harper in new york 
nathaniel hawthorne thought it a rich book he told evert augustus duyckinck a friend of melvilles with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life 
according to robert milder the book began as another south sea story but as he wrote melville left that genre behind first in favor of a romance of the narrator taji and the lost maiden yillah and then to an allegorical voyage of the philosopher babbalanja and his companions through the imaginary archipelago of mardi on february NUM NUM the melvilles first child malcolm was born 
in october NUM redburn was published by bentley in london and in november by harper in new york 
the bankruptcy and death of allan melville and melvilles own youthful humiliations surface in this story of outward adaptation and inner impairment 
biographer robertson-lorant regards the work as a deliberate attempt for popular appeal melville modeled each episode almost systematically on every genre that was popular with some group of antebellum readers combining elements of the picaresque novel the travelogue the nautical adventure the sentimental novel the sensational french romance the gothic thriller temperance tracts urban reform literature and the english pastoral 
in january NUM white-jacket was published by bentley in london and in march by harper in new york 
in early may NUM melville wrote to fellow sea author richard henry dana jr a letter that contains what is the earliest surviving mention of the writing of moby-dick saying he was already half way done 
in june he described the book to his english publisher as a romance of adventure founded upon certain wild legends in the southern sperm whale fisheries and promised it would be done by the fall 
the manuscript has not survived so it is impossible to know its state at this juncture 
over the next several months melville radically transformed his initial plan conceiving what delbanco has described as the most ambitious book ever conceived by an american writer 
from august NUM to NUM NUM the melvilles and their neighbor sarah morewood evert duyckinck oliver wendell holmes and other literary figures from new york and boston came to pittsfield to enjoy a period of social parties picnics dinners and the like 
on august NUM nathaniel hawthorne and his publisher james t fields joined the group while hawthornes wife stayed at home to look after the children 
as the men took a stroll through ice glen someone noticed that hawthorne and melville were absent and the group went looking for the two who were at last found deep in conversation 
the following day the group visited the hawthornes who since may had been living in nearby lenox 
i liked melville so much hawthorne wrote to his friend horatio bridge that i have asked him to spend a few days with me an uncharacteristic move for a man so attached to his work that he would not suffer overnight guests to keep him from it 
the following days melville wrote the essay hawthorne and his mosses a review of hawthornes mosses from an old manse that appeared in two installments on august NUM and NUM in the literary world
later that summer melville received a package from duyckinck with a letter asking him to forward it to hawthorne 
when he delivered the package to hawthorne he did not know it contained his last three books 
hawthorne read them as he wrote to duyckinck on august NUM with a progressive appreciation of their author 
he thought melville in redburn and white-jacket put the reality more unflinchingly before his reader than any writer and he thought mardi was a rich book with depths here and there that compel a man to swim for his life 
it is so good that one scarcely pardons the writer for not having brooded long over it so as to make it a great deal better 
in september NUM melville borrowed three thousand dollars from his father-in-law lemuel shaw to buy a NUM-acre farm in pittsfield 
melville called his new home arrowhead because of the arrowheads that were dug up around the property during planting season 
that winter melville on an impulse paid hawthorne a visit only to discover he was not in the mood for company as he was finishing the house of the seven gables
hawthornes wife sophia entertained him while he waited for hawthorne to come down for supper and gave him copies of twice-told tales and for malcolm the grandfathers chair
melville invited them to visit arrowhead some time in the next two weeks and when sophia agreed he looked forward to discussing the universe with a bottle of brandy  cigars with hawthorne 
a few days later sophia notified the melvilles that hawthorne could not stop working on his new book for more than one day and melville felt moved to repeat his invitation your bed is already made  the wood marked for your fire 
eventually melville visited the hawthornes again and the next day hawthorne surprised him by arriving at arrowhead with his daughter una 
according to robertson-lorant the handsome hawthorne made quite an impression on the melville women especially augusta who was a great fan of his books 
they spent the day mostly smoking and talking metaphysics 
in robertson-lorants assessment of the friendship melville was infatuated with hawthornes intellect captivated by his artistry and charmed by his elusive personality and though the two writers were drawn together in an undeniable sympathy of soul and intellect the friendship meant something different to each of them with hawthorne offering melville the kind of intellectual stimulation he needed 
they may have been natural allies and friends yet they were also fifteen years apart in age and temperamentally quite different and hawthorne found melvilles manic intensity exhausting at times 
melville wrote ten letters to hawthorne all of them effusive profound deeply affectionate 
melville was inspired and encouraged by his new relationship with hawthorne during the period that he was writing moby-dick 
he dedicated this new novel to hawthorne though their friendship was to wane only a short time later 
on october NUM NUM the whale was published in britain in three volumes and on november NUM moby-dick appeared in the united states as a single volume 
in between these dates on october NUM NUM the melvilles second child stanwix was born 
on december NUM hawthorne wrote a letter of appraisal to duyckinck prompted in part by his disagreement with the review in literary world what a book melville has written
it gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones 
it hardly seemed to me that the review of it in the literary world did justice to its best points 
in early december NUM melville visited the hawthornes in concord and discussed the idea of the agatha story which he had pitched to hawthorne 
this was the last known contact between the two writers before melville visited hawthorne in liverpool four years later 
melville had high hopes that his next book would please the public and restore his finances 
in april NUM he wrote to his british publisher richard bentley that his new book possessing unquestionable novelty is as i believe very much more calculated for popularity than anything you have yet published of minebeing a regular romance with a mysterious plot to it  stirring passions at work and withall representing a new  elevated aspect of american life .. in fact
 was heavily psychological though drawing on the conventions of the romance and difficult in style 
it was not well received 
the new york day book on september NUM NUM published a venomous attack headlined herman melville crazy 
the item offered as a news story reported
on NUM may NUM elizabeth bessie was born the melvilles third child and first daughter and on or about that day herman finished work on isle of the crossone relative wrote that the isle of the cross is almost a twin sister of the little one .. herman traveled to new york to discuss it with his publisher but later wrote that harper  brothers was prevented from publishing his manuscript presumed to be isle of the cross which has been lost 
finding it difficult to find a publisher for his follow-up novel to the commercial and critical failure of pierre israel potter the narrative of a revolutionary war veteran was first serialized in putnams monthly magazine in NUM
from november NUM to NUM melville published fourteen tales and sketches in putnams and harpers magazines 
in december NUM he proposed to dix  edwards the new owners of putnams that they publish a selection of the short fiction titled benito cereno and other sketches
the collection would eventually be named after a new introductory story melville had written for it the piazza and was published as the piazza tales with five previously published stories including bartleby the scrivener and benito cereno 
on march NUM NUM frances fanny was born the melvilles fourth child 
in this period his book israel potter was published 
the writing of the confidence-man put great strain on melville leading sam shaw a nephew of lizzie to write to his uncle lemuel shaw herman i hope has had no more of those ugly attacksa reference to what robertson-lorant calls the bouts of rheumatism and sciatica that plagued melville 
melvilles father-in-law apparently shared his daughters great anxiety about him when he wrote a letter to a cousin in which he described melvilles working habits when he is deeply engaged in one of his literary works he confines himself to hard study many hours in the day with little or no exercise  this specially in winter for a great many days together 
he probably thus overworks himself  brings on severe nervous affections 
shaw advanced melville NUM from lizzies inheritance to travel four or five months in europe and the holy land 
from october NUM NUM to may NUM NUM melville made a six-month grand tour of the british isles and the mediterranean 
while in england in november he spent three days with hawthorne who had taken an embassy position there 
at the seaside village of southport amid the sand dunes where they had stopped to smoke cigars they had a conversation which hawthorne later described in his journal
melvilles subsequent visit to the holy land inspired his epic poem clarel 
on april NUM NUM melville published his last full-length novel the confidence-man
this novel subtitled his masquerade has won general acclaim in modern times as a complex and mysterious exploration of issues of fraud and honesty identity and masquerade 
but when it was published it received reviews ranging from the bewildered to the denunciatory 
to repair his faltering finances melville was advised by friends to enter what had proven to be at least for others a remunerative field public lecturing 
from late NUM to NUM he embarked upon three lecture tours and spoke at lyceums chiefly on roman statuary and sightseeing in rome 
melvilles lectures which mocked the pseudo-intellectualism of lyceum culture were panned by contemporary audiences 
on may NUM NUM melville boarded the clipper meteor for california with his brother thomas at the helm 
after a shaky trip around cape horn melville returned alone to new york via panama in november 
turning to poetry he submitted a collection of verse to a publisher in NUM but it was not accepted 
in NUM he shook hands with abraham lincoln 
in NUM melville met with a road accident which left him seriously injured 
he also suffered from rheumatism 
in NUM he bought his brother allans house at NUM east NUMth street in new york city and moved there 
allan for his part bought arrowhead 
on march NUM his father-in-law died 
in NUM melville and allan paid a visit to the virginia battlefields of the american civil war 
after the end of the war he published battle pieces and aspects of the war NUM a collection of NUM poems that has been described as a polyphonic verse journal of the conflict
it was generally ignored by reviewers who gave him at best patronizingly favorable reviews 
the volume did not sell well of the harper  bros printing of NUM copies only NUM had been sold ten years later 
uneven as a collection of individual poems its achievement lies in the interplay of voices and moods throughout which melville patterns a shared historical experience into formative myth
in NUM melvilles wife and her relatives used their influence to obtain a position for him as customs inspector for the city of new york a humble but adequately paying appointment 
he held the post for NUM years and won the reputation of being the only honest employee in a notoriously corrupt institution 
unbeknownst to him his modest position and income were protected throughout the periodic turmoil of political reappointments by a customs official who never spoke to melville but admired his writings future us president chester a arthur
in NUM his oldest son malcolm shot himself perhaps accidentally and died at home at the age of NUM
some psychologists believe it was a suicide 
the job came as a relief for his family because he would be out of the house for much of the day 
melville suffered from unpredictable mood swings habitually bullying his servants wife and children 
as robertson-lorants writes like the tyrannical captains he had portrayed in his novels melville probably provoked rebellious feelings in his crew by the capricious way he ruled the home especially when he was drinking 
nervous exhaustion and physical pain rendered him short-tempered made worse by his drinking 
robertson-lorant takes the different ways one can look at melville in this period to their extremes

in may NUM sam shaw contacted lizzies minister henry bellows asking assistance with his sisters case which has been a cause of anxiety to all of us for years past 
a wife then could not leave her husband without losing all claims to the children so bellows suggested lizzie be kidnapped and brought to boston 
shaw suspected that lizzie would not agree to such melodramatic scheme 
he thought up a different scheme in which lizzie would visit boston and friends would inform herman she would not come back 
to get a divorce she would then have to bring charges against melville believing her husband to be insane 
though melvilles professional writing career had ended he remained dedicated to his writing 
he bought books on poetry landscape art and engraving 
he had a rembrandt mezzotint framed in his new york residence 
in NUM his brother allan died as did his mother aged eighty-two 
melville devoted years to his autumnal masterpiece an NUM-line epic poem titled  clarel a poem and a pilgrimage inspired by his NUM trip to the holy land 
it is among the longest single poems in american literature 
the title character is a young american student of divinity who travels to jerusalem to renew his faith 
one of the central characters rolfe is similar to melville in his younger days a seeker and adventurer while the reclusive vine is loosely based on hawthorne who had died twelve years before 
a bequest from his uncle peter gansevoort paid for publication in NUM but epic-length verse-narrative was considered quite obscure even in his own time 
the book had an initial printing of NUM copies but sales failed miserably and the unsold copies were burned when melville was unable to afford to buy them at cost 
the critic lewis mumford found a copy in the new york public library in NUM with its pages uncutin other words it had sat there unread for NUM years 
in NUM mrs melville received a legacy which enabled her to allow melville a monthly sum of NUM to spend on books and prints 
while melville had his steady customs job he no longer showed signs of depression which recurred after the death of his second son 
on NUM february NUM stanwix melville died in san francisco at age NUM
melville retired on NUM december NUM after several of his wifes relatives died and left the couple more legacies which mrs melville administered with skill and good fortune 
in NUM melville became a member of the new york society library 
asenglishreaderspursuing the vogue for sea stories represented by such writers as g a henty rediscovered melvilles novels in the late nineteenth century the author had a modest revival of popularity in england though not in the united states 
he wrote a series of poems with prose head notes inspired by his early experiences at sea 
he published them in two collections each issued in a tiny edition of NUM copies for his relatives and friends 
of these scholar robert milder calls john marr and other poems NUM the finest of his late verse collections
the second privately printed volume is timoleon NUM
intrigued by one of these poems melville began to rework the headnote expanding it first as a short story and eventually as a novella 
he worked on it on and off for several years but when he died in september NUM the piece was unfinished 
also left unpublished were another volume of poetry weeds and wildings and a sketch daniel orme 
to billy budd his widow added notes and edited it but the manuscript was not discovered until NUM by raymond weaver his first biographer 
he worked at transcribing and editing a full text which he published in NUM as billy budd sailor 
it was an immediate critical success in england and soon one in the united states 
the authoritative version was published in NUM after two scholars studied the papers for several years 
in NUM it was adapted as a stage play on broadway and as an opera by english composer benjamin britten with assistance on the libretto by em forster 
in NUM peter ustinov released a movie based on the stage play and starring terence stamp 
melville died at his home in new york city early on the morning of september NUM NUM at age NUM
the doctor listed cardiac dilation on the death certificate 
he was interred in the woodlawn cemetery in the bronx new york city 
a common story recounts that his new york times obituary called him henry melville implying that he was unknown and unappreciated at his time of death but the story is not true 
a later article was published on october NUM in the same paper referring to him as the late hiram melville but this appears to have been a typesetting error 
melvilles writing style shows enormous changes throughout the years as well as consistencies 
in the words of arvin melvilles development had been abnormally postponed and when it came it came with a rush and a force that had the menace of quick exhaustion in it 
as early a juvenile piece as fragments from a writing desk from NUM scholar sealts points out already shows a number of elements that anticipate melvilles later writing especially his characteristic habit of abundant literary allusion
typee and omoo were documentary adventures that called for a division of the narrative in short chapters 
such compact organization bears the risk of fragmentation when applied to a lengthy work such as mardi but with redburn and white jacket melville turned the short chapter into an instrument of form and concentration 
a number of chapters of moby-dick are no longer than two pages in standard editions and an extreme example is chapter NUM consisting of a single paragraph of NUM words including the thrice-repeated um um um 
the skillful handling of chapters in moby-dick is one of the most fully developed melvillean signatures and is a measure of his manner of mastery as a writer
individual chapters have become a touchstone for appreciation of melvilles art and for explanation of his themes 
in contrast the chapters in pierre called books are divided into short numbered sections seemingly an odd formal compromise between melvilles natural length and his purpose to write a regular romance that called for longer chapters 
as satirical elements were introduced the chapter arrangement restores some degree of organization and pace from the chaos
the usual chapter unit then reappears for israel potter the confidence-man and even clarel but only becomes a vital part in the whole creative achievement again in the juxtaposition of accents and of topics in billy budd
newton arvin points out that only superficially the books after mardi seem as if melvilles writing went back to the vein of his first two books 
in reality his movement was not a retrograde but a spiral one and while redburn and white-jacket may lack the spontaneous youthful charm of his first two books they are denser in substance richer in feeling tauter more complex more connotative in texture and imagery 
the rhythm of the prose in omoo achieves little more than easiness the language is almost neutral and without idiosyncrasy yet redburn shows a gain in rhythmical variety and intricacy in sharpness of diction in syntactical resource in painterly bravura and the fusing of image and emotion into a unity of strangeness beauty and dread
melvilles early works were increasingly baroque in style and with moby-dick melvilles vocabulary had grown superabundant 
bezanson calls it an immensely varied style
according to critic warner berthoff three characteristic uses of language can be recognized 
first the exaggerated repetition of words as in the series pitiable pity pitied and piteous ch 
NUM the pequod meets the virgin
a second typical device is the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations as in concentrating brow and immaculate manliness ch 
NUM knights and squires
a third characteristic is the presence of a participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader as the words preluding and foreshadowing so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene .. in this foreshadowing interval ..
after his use of hyphenated compounds in pierre melvilles writing gives berthoff the impression of becoming less exploratory and less provocative in his choices of words and phrases 
instead of providing a lead into possible meanings and openings-out of the material in hand the vocabulary now served to crystallize governing impressions the diction no longer attracted attention to itself except as an effort at exact definition 
the language berthoff continues reflects a controlling intelligence of right judgment and completed understanding
the sense of free inquiry and exploration which infused his earlier writing and accounted for its rare force and expansiveness tended to give way to static enumeration 
for berthoff added seriousness of consideration came at the cost of losing pace and momentum
the verbal music and kinetic energy of moby-dick seem relatively muted even withheld in the later works 
melvilles paragraphing in his best work berthoff considers to be the virtuous result of compactness of form and free assembling of unanticipated further data such as when the mysterious sperm whale is compared with exoduss invisibility of gods face in the final paragraph of chapter NUM the tail
over time melvilles paragraphs became shorter as his sentences grew longer until he arrived at the one-sentence paragraphing characteristic of his later prose 
berthoff points to the opening chapter of the confidence-man for an example as it counts fifteen paragraphs seven of which consist of only one elaborate sentence and four that have only two sentences 
the use of similar technique in billy budd contributes in large part berthoff says to its remarkable narrative economy
in nathalia wrights view melvilles sentences generally have a looseness of structure easy to use for devices as catalogue and allusion parallel and refrain proverb and allegory 
the length of his clauses may vary greatly but the torterous writing in pierre and the confidence-man is there to convey feeling not thought 
unlike henry james who was an innovator of sentence ordering to render the subtlest nuances in thought melville made few such innovations 
his domain is the mainstream of english prose with its rhythm and simplicity influenced by the king james bible 
another important characteristic of melvilles writing style is in its echoes and overtones 
melvilles imitation of certain distinct styles is responsible for this 
his three most important sources in order are the bible shakespeare and milton 
scholar nathalia wright has identified three stylistic categories of biblical influence 
direct quotation from any of the sources is slight only one sixth of his biblical allusions can be qualified as such 
first far more unmarked than acknowledged quotations occur some favorites even numerous times throughout his whole body of work taking on the nature of refrains 
examples of this idiom are the injunctions to be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves death on a pale horse the man of sorrows the many mansions of heaven proverbs as the hairs on our heads are numbered pride goes before a fall the wages of sin is death adverbs and pronouns as verily whoso forasmuch as phrases as come to pass childrens children the fat of the land vanity of vanities outer darkness the apple of his eye ancient of days the rose of sharon 
second there are paraphrases of individual and combined verses 
redburns thou shalt not lay stripes upon these roman citizens makes use of language of the ten commandments in ex NUM and pierres inquiry of lucy loveth she me with the love past all understanding
combines john NUM and philippians NUM

third certain hebraisms are used such as a succession of genitives all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob the cognate accusative i dreamed a dream liverpool was created with the creation and the parallel closer home does it go than a rammer and fighting with steel is a play without ever an interlude
a passage from redburn see quotebox shows how all these different ways of alluding interlock and result in a fabric texture of biblical language though there is very little direct quotation 
in addition to this melville successfully imitates three biblical strains he sustains the apocalyptic for a whole chapter of mardi the prophetic strain is expressed in moby-dick most notably in father mapples sermon and the tradition of the psalms is imitated at length in the confidence-man
melville owned an edition of shakespeares works by NUM and his reading of it greatly influenced the style of his next book moby-dick NUM
the critic fo 
matthiessen found that the language of shakespeare far surpasses other influences upon the book in that it inspired melville to discover his own full strength 
on almost every page debts to shakespeare can be discovered 
the mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing at the end of cetology ch NUM echo the famous phrase in macbeth told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing 
ahabs first extended speech to the crew in the quarter-deck ch NUM is practically blank verse and so is ahabs soliloquy at the beginning of sunset ch NUMi leave a white and turbid wake pale waters paler cheeks whereer i sail  the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track let them but first i pass 
through shakespeare melville infused moby-dick with a power of expression he had not previously possessed 
reading shakespeare had been a catalytic agent for melville one that transformed his writing from merely reporting to the expression of profound natural forces 
the extent to which melville assimilated shakespeare is evident in the description of ahab matthiessen continues which ends in language that seems shakespearean yet is no imitation oh ahab
what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air
the imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly shakespearean but its two key words appear only once each in the plays ..and to neither of these usages is melville indebted for his fresh combination 
melvilles diction depended upon no source and his prose is not based on anybody elses verse but on an awareness of speech rhythm
melvilles mastering of shakespeare matthiessen finds supplied him with verbal resources that enabled him to create dramatic language through three essential techniques 
first the use of verbs of action creates a sense of movement and meaning 
the effective tension caused by the contrast of thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds and theres that in here that still remains indifferent in the candles ch 
NUM makes the last clause lead to a compulsion to strike the breast which suggests how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words second melville took advantage of the shakespearean energy of verbal compounds as in full-freighted
third melville employed the device of making one part of speech act as another - for example earthquake as an adjective or turning an adjective into a noun as in placeless
melvilles style in nathalia wrights analysis seamlessly flows over into theme because all these borrowings have an artistic purpose which is to suggest an appearance larger and more significant than life for characters and themes that are in fact unremarkable 
the allusions suggest that beyond the world of appearances another world exists one that influences this world and where ultimate truth can be found 
moreover the ancient background thus suggested for melvilles narratives ancient allusions being next in number to the biblical ones invests them with a sense of timelessness 
melville was not financially successful as a writer having earned just over NUM for his writing during his lifetime 
his popularity declined dramatically after his success with travelogues based on voyages to the south seas and his stories based on misadventures in the merchant marine and navy 
by NUM all of his books were out of print 
he was viewed as a minor figure in american literature in the later years of his life and during the years after his death 
the melville revival of the late NUMs and NUMs brought about a reassessment of his work 
the centennial of his birth was in NUM
carl van dorens NUM article on melville in a standard history of american literature was the start of renewed appreciation 
van doren also encouraged raymond weaver who wrote the authors first full-length biography herman melville mariner and mystic NUM
discovering the unfinished manuscript of billy budd among papers shown to him by melvilles granddaughter weaver edited it and published it in a new collected edition of melvilles works 
other works that helped fan the flames for melville were carl van dorens the american novel NUM d h lawrences studies in classic american literature NUM carl van vechtens essay in the double dealer NUM and lewis mumfords biography herman melville a study of his life and vision NUM
starting in the mid-NUMs the yale university scholar stanley williams supervised more than a dozen dissertations on melville that were eventually published as books 
where the first wave of melville scholars focused on psychology williams students were prominent in establishing melville studies as an academic field concerned with texts and manuscripts tracing melvilles influences and borrowings even plagiarism and exploring archives and local publications 
jay leyda known for his work in film spent more than a decade in archives and small-town libraries gathering documents and records for a day by day record published as melville log NUM
sparked by leyda the second phase of the melville revival emphasized research rather than accepting melvilles early books as reliable accounts 
the postwar scholars tended to think that weaver harvard psychologist henry murray and mumford favored freudian interpretations which read melvilles fiction too literally as autobiography exaggerated his suffering in the family and mistakenly inferred a homosexual attachment to hawthorne 
they saw a different arc to melvilles writing career 
the first biographers saw a tragic withdrawal after the cold critical reception for his prose works and largely dismissed his poetry 
a new view emerged of melvilles turn to poetry as a conscious choice that placed him among the most important american poets 
other post-war studies however continued the broad imaginative and interpretive style 
charles olsons call me ishmael NUM presented ahab as a shakespearean tragic hero and newton arvins critical biography herman melville NUM won the national book award for non-fiction in NUM
hershel parker published his two volume herman melville a biography in NUM and NUM based on extensive original research and his involvement as editor of the northwestern-newberry melville edition 
in the NUMs northwestern university press in alliance with the newberry library and the modern language association organized a project to edit and published reliable critical texts of melvilles complete works including unpublished poems journals and correspondence 
the aim of the editors was to present a text as close as possible to the authors intention as surviving evidence permits
the volumes have extensive appendices including textual variants from each of the editions published in melvilles lifetime an historical note on the publishing history and critical reception and related documents 
in many cases it was not possible to establish a definitive text but the edition supplies all evidence available at the time 
because the texts were prepared with financial support from the united states department of education no royalties are charged and they have been widely reprinted 
in NUM the melville society was founded a non-profit organisation dedicated to the study of melvilles life and works 
between NUM and NUM it published NUM issues of melville society extracts which are now freely available on the societys website 
since NUM it publishes leviathan a journal of melville studies currently three issues a year published by johns hopkins university press 
melville did not publish poetry until late in life and his reputation as a poet was not high until late in the NUMth century 
melville says recent literary critic lawrence buell is justly said to be nineteenth-century americas leading poet after whitman and dickinson yet his poetry remains largely unread even by many melvillians 
true buell concedes even more than most victorian poets melville turned to poetry as an instrument of meditation rather than for the sake of melody or linguistic play 
it is also true that he turned from fiction to poetry late in life 
yet he wrote twice as much poetry as dickinson and probably as many lines as whitman and he wrote distinguished poetry for a quarter of a century twice as long as his career publishing prose narratives 
the three novels of the NUMs which melville worked on most seriously to present his philosophical explorations moby-dick pierre and the confidence man seem to make the step to philosophical poetry a natural one rather than simply a consequence of commercial failure 
in NUM the melville scholar elizabeth renker wrote a sea change in the reception of the poems is incipient 
some critics now place him as the first modernist poet in the united states others assert that his work more strongly suggests what today would be a postmodern view 
henry chapin wrote in an introduction to john marr and other sailors NUM a collection of melvilles late poetry melvilles loveable freshness of personality is everywhere in evidence in the voice of a true poet 
the poet and novelist robert penn warren was a leading champion of melville as a great american poet 
warren issued a selection of melvilles poetry prefaced by an admiring critical essay 
the poetry critic helen vendler remarked of clarel  what it cost melville to write this poem makes us pause reading it 
alone it is enough to win him as a poet what he called the belated funeral flower of fame 
melvilles writings did not attract the attention of womens studies scholars of the NUMs and NUMs though his preference for sea-going tales that involved almost only males has been of interest to scholars in mens studies and especially gay and queer studies 
melville was remarkably open in his exploration of sexuality of all sorts 
for example alvin sandberg claimed that the short story the paradise of bachelors and the tartarus of maids offers an exploration of impotency a portrayal of a man retreating to an all-male childhood to avoid confrontation with sexual manhood from which the narrator engages in congenial digressions in heterogeneity 
in line with this view warren rosenberg argues the homosocial paradise of bachelors is shown to be superficial and sterile 
david harley serlin observes in the second half of melvilles diptych the tartarus of maids the narrator gives voice to the oppressed women he observes

issues of sexuality have been observed in other works as well 
rosenberg notes taji in mardi and the protagonist in pierre think they are saving young maidens in distress yillah and isabel out of the purest of reasons but both are also conscious of a lurking sexual motive
when taji kills the old priest holding yillah captive he says
in pierre the motive of the protagonists sacrifice for isabel is admitted womanly beauty and not womanly ugliness invited him to champion the right 
rosenberg argues
rosenberg says that melville fully explores the theme of sexuality in his major epic poem clarel 
when the narrator is separated from ruth with whom he has fallen in love he is free to explore other sexual and religious possibilities before deciding at the end of the poem to participate in the ritualistic order represented by marriage 
in the course of the poem he considers every form of sexual orientation  celibacy homosexuality hedonism and heterosexuality  raising the same kinds of questions as when he considers islam or democracy 
some passages and sections of melvilles works demonstrate his willingness to address all forms of sexuality including the homoerotic in his works 
commonly noted examples from moby-dick are the marriage bed episode involving ishmael and queequeg which is interpreted as male bonding and the squeeze of the hand chapter describing the camaraderie of sailors extracting spermaceti from a dead whale 
rosenberg notes that critics say that ahabs pursuit of the whale which they suggest can be associated with the feminine in its shape mystery and in its naturalness represents the ultimate fusion of the epistemological and sexual quest 
in addition he notes that billy budds physical attractiveness is described in quasi-feminine terms as the handsome sailor billy budds position aboard the seventy-four was something analogous to that of a rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into competition with the highborn dames of the court 
since the late NUMth century billy budd has become a central text in the field of legal scholarship known as law and literature 
in the novel billy a handsome and popular young sailor is impressed from the merchant vessel rights of man to serve aboard hm s 
bellipotent in the late NUMs during the war between revolutionary france and great britain 
he excites the enmity and hatred of the ships master-at-arms john claggart 
claggart brings phony charges against billy accusing him of mutiny and other crimes and the captain the honorable edward fairfax vere brings them together for an informal inquiry 
at this encounter billy is frustrated by his stammer which prevents him from speaking and strikes claggart 
the blow catches claggart squarely on the forehead and after a gasp or two the master-at-arms dies 
vere immediately convenes a court-martial at which after serving as sole witness and as billys de facto counsel vere urges the court to convict and sentence billy to death 
the trial is recounted in chapter NUM the longest chapter in the book 
it has become the focus of scholarly controversy was captain vere a good man trapped by bad law or did he deliberately distort and misrepresent the applicable law to condemn billy to death
as early as NUM in the juvenile sketch fragments from a writing desk melville explores a problem which would reappear in the short stories bartleby NUM and benito cereno NUM the impossibility to find common ground for mutual communication 
the sketch centers on the protagonist and a mute lady leading scholar sealts to observe melvilles deep concern with expression and communication evidently began early in his career 
according to scholar nathalia wright melvilles characters are all preoccupied by the same intense superhuman and eternal quest for the absolute amidst its relative manifestations an enterprise central to the melville canon all melvilles plots describe this pursuit and all his themes represent the delicate and shifting relationship between its truth and its illusion 
it is not clear however what the moral and metaphysical implications of this quest are because melville did not distinguish between these two aspects 
throughout his life melville struggled with and gave shape to the same set of epistemological doubts and the metaphysical issues these doubts engendered 
an obsession for the limits of knowledge led to the question of gods existence and nature the indifference of the universe and the problem of evil 
in NUM the new york city herman melville society gathered at NUM east NUMth street to dedicate the intersection of park avenue south and NUMth street as herman melville square 
this is the street where melville lived from NUM to NUM and where among other works he wrote billy budd
in NUM a species of extinct giant sperm whale livyatan melvillei was named in honor of melville 
the paleontologists who discovered the fossil were fans of moby-dick and dedicated their discovery to the author 
melville hall the commissioned officers club at the united states merchant marine academy in kings point new york is named in his honor 
adventures of huckleberry finn

adventures of huckleberry finn or in more recent editions the adventures of huckleberry finn is a novel by mark twain first published in the united kingdom in december NUM and in the united states in february NUM

it is a direct sequel to the adventures of tom sawyer
the book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the mississippi river 
set in a southern antebellum society that had ceased to exist about NUM years before the work was published adventures of huckleberry finn is an often scathing satire on entrenched attitudes particularly racism 
perennially popular with readers adventures of huckleberry finn has also been the continued object of study by literary critics since its publication 
the book was widely criticized upon release because of its extensive use of coarse language 
throughout the NUMth century and despite arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist criticism of the book continued due to both its perceived use of racial stereotypes and its frequent use of the racial slur nigger
in order of appearance

jim has also run away after he overheard miss watson planning to sell him down the river to presumably more brutal owners 
jim plans to make his way to the town of cairo in illinois a free state so that he can later buy the rest of his enslaved familys freedom 
at first huck is conflicted about the sin and crime of supporting a runaway slave but as the two talk in depth and bond over their mutually held superstitions huck emotionally connects with jim who increasingly becomes hucks close friend and guardian 
after heavy flooding on the river the two find a raft which they keep as well as an entire house floating on the river chapter NUM the house of death floats by
entering the house to seek loot jim finds the naked body of a dead man lying on the floor shot in the back 
he prevents huck from viewing the corpse 
to find out the latest news in town huck dresses as a girl and enters the house of judith loftus a woman new to the area

jim is not deceived for long and is deeply hurt that his friend should have teased him so mercilessly 
huck becomes remorseful and apologizes to jim though his conscience troubles him about humbling himself to a black man 
traveling onward huck and jims raft is struck by a passing steamship again separating the two 
huck is given shelter on the kentucky side of the river by the grangerfords an aristocratic family 
he befriends buck grangerford a boy about his age and learns that the grangerfords are engaged in a NUM-year blood feud against another family the shepherdsons 
the grangerfords and shepherdsons go to the same church which ironically preaches brotherly love 
the vendetta finally comes to a head when bucks older sister elopes with a member of the shepherdson clan 
in the resulting conflict all the grangerford males from this branch of the family are shot and killed including buck whose horrific murder huck witnesses 
he is immensely relieved to be reunited with jim who has since recovered and repaired the raft 
near the arkansas-missouri-tennessee border jim and huck take two on-the-run grifters aboard the raft 
the younger man who is about thirty introduces himself as the long-lost son of an english duke the duke of bridgewater
the older one about seventy then trumps this outrageous claim by alleging that he himself is the lost dauphin the son of louis xvi and rightful king of france 
the duke and king soon become permanent passengers on jim and hucks raft committing a series of confidence schemes upon unsuspecting locals all along their journey 
to divert suspicions from the public away from jim they pose him as recaptured slave runaway but later paint him up entirely blue and call him the sick arab so that he can move about the raft without bindings 
on one occasion the swindlers advertise a three-night engagement of a play called the royal nonesuch
the play turns out to be only a couple of minutes worth of an absurd bawdy sham 
on the afternoon of the first performance a drunk called boggs is shot dead by a gentleman named colonel sherburn a lynch mob forms to retaliate against sherburn and sherburn surrounded at his home disperses the mob by making a defiant speech describing how true lynching should be done 
by the third night of the royal nonesuch the townspeople prepare for their revenge on the duke and king for their money-making scam but the two cleverly skip town together with huck and jim just before the performance begins 
in the next town the two swindlers then impersonate brothers of peter wilks a recently deceased man of property 
to match accounts of wilkss brothers the king attempts an english accent and the duke pretends to be a deaf-mute while starting to collect wilkss inheritance 
huck decides that wilkss three orphaned nieces who treat huck with kindness do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance 
in a desperate moment huck is forced to hide the money in wilkss coffin which is abruptly buried the next morning 
the arrival of two new men who seem to be the real brothers throws everything into confusion so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin in order to determine which are the true brothers but with everyone else distracted huck leaves for the raft hoping to never see the duke and king again 
suddenly though the two villains return much to hucks despair 
when huck is finally able to get away a second time he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward 
defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actionsall right then ill go to hell
huck resolves to free jim once and for all 
huck learns that jim is being held at the plantation of silas and sally phelps 
the familys nephew tom is expected for a visit at the same time as hucks arrival so huck is mistaken for tom and welcomed into their home 
he plays along hoping to find jims location and free him in a surprising plot twist it is revealed that the expected nephew is in fact tom sawyer 
when huck intercepts the real tom sawyer on the road and tells him everything tom decides to join hucks scheme pretending to be his own younger half-brother sid while huck continues pretending to be tom 
in the meantime jim has told the family about the two grifters and the new plan for the royal nonesuch and so the townspeople capture the duke and king who are then tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail 
rather than simply sneaking jim out of the shed where he is being held tom develops an elaborate plan to free him involving secret messages a hidden tunnel snakes in a shed a rope ladder sent in jims food and other elements from adventure books he has read including an anonymous note to the phelps warning them of the whole scheme 
during the actual escape and resulting pursuit tom is shot in the leg while jim remains by his side risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone 
although a local doctor admires jims decency he has jim arrested in his sleep and returned to the phelps 
after this events quickly resolve themselves 
toms aunt polly arrives and reveals huck and toms true identities to the phelps family 
jim is revealed to be a free man miss watson died two months earlier and freed jim in her will but tom who already knew this chose not to reveal this information to huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for jim 
jim tells huck that hucks father pap finn has been dead for some time he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house and so huck may now return safely to st petersburg 
huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story and despite sallys plans to adopt and civilize him he intends to flee west to indian territory 
adventures of huckleberry finn explores themes of race and identity 
a complexity exists concerning jims character 
while some scholars point out that jim is good-hearted moral and he is not unintelligent in contrast to several of the more negatively depicted white characters others have criticized the novel as racist citing the use of the word nigger and emphasizing the stereotypically comic treatment of jims lack of education superstition and ignorance 
throughout the story huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of jims friendship and jims human worth a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught 
mark twain in his lecture notes proposes that a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience and goes on to describe the novel as ...a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat
to highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system twain has hucks father enslave his son isolate him and beat him 
when huck escapes he then immediately encounters jim illegally doing the same thing 
the treatment both of them receive are radically different especially with an encounter with mrs judith loftus who takes pity on who she presumes to be a runaway apprentice huck yet boasts about her husband sending the hounds after a runaway slave jim 
some scholars discuss hucks own character and the novel itself in the context of its relation to african-american culture as a whole 
john alberti quotes shelley fisher fishkin who writes in her NUMs book was huck black
 mark twain and african-american voices by limiting their field of inquiry to the periphery white scholars have missed the ways in which african-american voices shaped twains creative imagination at its core 
it is suggested that the character of huckleberry finn illustrates the correlation and even interrelatedness between white and black culture in the united states 
the original illustrations were done by ew 
kemble at the time a young artist working for life magazine 
kemble was hand-picked by twain who admired his work 
hearn suggests that twain and kemble had a similar skill writing that
whatever he may have lacked in technical grace  .. kemble shared with the greatest illustrators the ability to give even the minor individual in a text his own distinct visual personality just as twain so deftly defined a full-rounded character in a few phrases so too did kemble depict with a few strokes of his pen that same entire personage 
as kemble could afford only one model most of his illustrations produced for the book were done by guesswork 
when the novel was published the illustrations were praised even as the novel was harshly criticized 
ew 
kemble produced another set of illustrations for harpers and the american publishing company in NUM and NUM after twain lost the copyright 
twain initially conceived of the work as a sequel to the adventures of tom sawyer that would follow huckleberry finn through adulthood 
beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled huckleberry finns autobiography 
twain worked on the manuscript off and on for the next several years ultimately abandoning his original plan of following hucks development into adulthood 
he appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress and set it aside for several years 
after making a trip down the hudson river twain returned to his work on the novel 
upon completion the novels title closely paralleled its predecessors adventures of huckleberry finn tom sawyers comrade
mark twain composed the story in pen on notepaper between NUM and NUM
paul needham who supervised the authentication of the manuscript for sothebys books and manuscripts department in new york in NUM stated what you see is clemens attempt to move away from pure literary writing to dialect writing
for example twain revised the opening line of huck finn three times 
he initially wrote you will not know about me which he changed to you do not know about me before settling on the final version you dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of the adventures of tom sawyer but that aint no matter 
the revisions also show how twain reworked his material to strengthen the characters of huck and jim as well as his sensitivity to the then-current debate over literacy and voting 
a later version was the first typewritten manuscript delivered to a printer 
demand for the book spread outside of the united states 
adventures of huckleberry finn was eventually published on december NUM NUM in canada and the united kingdom and on february NUM NUM in the united states 
the illustration on page NUM became a point of issue after an engraver whose identity was never discovered made a last-minute addition to the printing plate of kembles picture of old silas phelps which drew attention to phelps groin 
thirty thousand copies of the book had been printed before the obscenity was discovered 
a new plate was made to correct the illustration and repair the existing copies 
in NUM the buffalo public librarys curator james fraser gluck approached twain to donate the manuscript to the library 
twain did so 
later it was believed that half of the pages had been misplaced by the printer 
in NUM the missing first half turned up in a steamer trunk owned by descendants of glucks 
the library successfully claimed possession and in NUM opened the mark twain room to showcase the treasure 
in relation to the literary climate at the time of the books publication in NUM henry nash smith describes the importance of mark twains already established reputation as a professional humorist having already published over a dozen other works 
smith suggests that while the dismantling of the decadent romanticism of the later nineteenth century was a necessary operation adventures of huckleberry finn illustrated previously inaccessible resources of imaginative power but also made vernacular language with its new sources of pleasure and new energy available for american prose and poetry in the twentieth century 
while it was clear that the publication of adventures of huckleberry finn was controversial from the outset norman mailer writing in the new york times in NUM concluded that twains novel was not initially too unpleasantly regarded 
in fact mailer writes the critical climate could hardly anticipate t s eliot and ernest hemingways encomiums NUM years later reviews that would remain longstanding in the american consciousness 
alberti suggests that the academic establishment responded to the books challenges both dismissively and with confusion 
during twains time and today defenders of adventures of huckleberry finn lump all nonacademic critics of the book together as extremists and censors thus equating the complaints about the books coarseness from the genteel bourgeois trustees of the concord public library in the NUMs with more recent objections based on race and civil rights 
upon issue of the american edition in NUM several libraries banned it from their shelves 
the early criticism focused on what was perceived as the books crudeness 
one incident was recounted in the newspaper the boston transcript

the concord mass 
public library committee has decided to exclude mark twains latest book from the library 
one member of the committee says that while he does not wish to call it immoral he thinks it contains but little humor and that of a very coarse type 
he regards it as the veriest trash 
the library and the other members of the committee entertain similar views characterizing it as rough coarse and inelegant dealing with a series of experiences not elevating the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent respectable people 
writer louisa may alcott criticized the books publication as well saying that if twain could not think of something better to tell our pure-minded lads and lasses he had best stop writing for them
twain later remarked to his editor apparently the concord library has condemned huck as trash and only suitable for the slums 
this will sell us another twenty-five thousand copies for sure
in NUM new yorks brooklyn public library also banned the book due to bad word choice and hucks having not only itched but scratched within the novel which was considered obscene 
when asked by a brooklyn librarian about the situation twain sardonically replied i am greatly troubled by what you say 
i wrote tom sawyer  huck finn for adults exclusively  it always distressed me when i find that boys and girls have been allowed access to them 
the mind that becomes soiled in youth can never again be washed clean 
i know this by my own experience  to this day i cherish an unappeased bitterness against the unfaithful guardians of my young life who not only permitted but compelled me to read an unexpurgated bible through before i was NUM years old 
none can do that and ever draw a clean sweet breath again on this side of the grave 
many subsequent critics ernest hemingway among them have deprecated the final chapters claiming the book devolves into little more than minstrel-show satire and broad comedy after jim is detained 
although hemingway declared all modern american literature comes from huck finn and hailed it as the best book weve had he cautioned if you must read it you must stop where the nigger jim is stolen from the boys  
that is the real end 
the rest is just cheating 
pulitzer prize winner ron powers states in his twain biography mark twain a life that huckleberry finn endures as a consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters in which tom sawyer leads huck through elaborate machinations to rescue jim 
in his introduction to the annotated huckleberry finn michael patrick hearn writes that twain could be uninhibitedly vulgar and quotes critic william dean howells a twain contemporary who wrote that the authors humor was not for most women
however hearn continues by explaining that the reticent howells found nothing in the proofs of huckleberry finn so offensive that it needed to be struck out
much of modern scholarship of huckleberry finn has focused on its treatment of race 
many twain scholars have argued that the book by humanizing jim and exposing the fallacies of the racist assumptions of slavery is an attack on racism 
others have argued that the book falls short on this score especially in its depiction of jim 
according to professor stephen railton of the university of virginia twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed and therefore resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at jims expense and ended up confirming rather than challenging late-NUMth century racist stereotypes 
in one instance the controversy caused a drastically altered interpretation of the text in NUM cbs tried to avoid controversial material in a televised version of the book by deleting all mention of slavery and omitting the character of jim entirely 
because of this controversy over whether huckleberry finn is racist or anti-racist and because the word nigger is frequently used in the novel a commonly used word in twains time which has since become vulgar and taboo many have questioned the appropriateness of teaching the book in the us public school systemthis questioning of the word nigger is illustrated by a school administrator of virginia in NUM calling the novel the most grotesque example of racism ive ever seen in my life
according to the american library association huckleberry finn was the fifth most frequently challenged book in the united states during the NUMs 
there have been several more recent cases involving protests for the banning of the novel 
in NUM high school student calista phair and her grandmother beatrice clark in renton washington proposed banning the book from classroom learning in the renton school district though not from any public libraries because of the word nigger
clark filed a request with the school district in response to the required reading of the book asking for the novel to be removed from the english curriculum 
the two curriculum committees that considered her request eventually decided to keep the novel on the NUMth grade curriculum though they suspended it until a panel had time to review the novel and set a specific teaching procedure for the novels controversial topics 
in NUM a washington state high school teacher called for the removal of the novel from a school curriculum 
the teacher john foley called for replacing adventures of huckleberry finn with a more modern novel 
in an opinion column that foley wrote in the seattle post intelligencer he states that all novels that use the n-word repeatedly need to go 
he states that teaching the novel is not only unnecessary but difficult due to the offensive language within the novel with many students becoming uncomfortable at just hearing the n-word 
he views this change as common sense with obamas election into office as a sign that americans are ready for a change and that by removing these books from the reading lists they would be following this change 
publishers of the book have made their own attempts at easing the controversy by way of less-coarse publications 
a NUM edition of the book published by newsouth books replaced the word nigger with slave although being incorrectly addressed to a freed man and did not use the term injun 
mark twain scholar alan gribben said he hoped the edition would be more friendly for use in classrooms rather than have the work banned outright from classroom reading lists due to its language 
according to publisher suzanne la rosa at newsouth we saw the value in an edition that would help the works find new readers 
if the publication sparks good debate about how language impacts learning or about the nature of censorship or the way in which racial slurs exercise their baneful influence then our mission in publishing this new edition of twains works will be more emphatically fulfilled 
another scholar thomas wortham criticized the changes saying the new edition doesnt challenge children to ask why would a child like huck use such reprehensible language
in NUM adventures of huckleberry finn was removed from a public school district in virginia along with the novel to kill a mockingbird due to their use of racial slurs 
responses to this include the publishing of the hipster huckleberry finn which is an edition with the word nigger replaced with the word hipster
the books description includes this statement thanks to editor richard grayson the adventures of huckleberry finn are now neither offensive nor uncool

updike was born in reading pennsylvania the only child of linda grace ne hoyer and wesley russell updike and was raised in the nearby small town of shillington 
the family later moved to the unincorporated village of plowville 
his mothers attempts to become a published writer impressed the young updike

i admired the writers equipment the typewriter eraser the boxes of clean paper 
and i remember the brown envelopes that stories would go off inand come back in 
these early years in berks county pennsylvania would influence the environment of the rabbit angstrom tetralogy as well as many of his early novels and short stories 
updike graduated from shillington high school as co-valedictorian and class president in NUM and received a full scholarship to harvard college where he was the roommate of christopher lasch during their freshman year

in new york updike wrote the poems and stories that came to fill his early books like the carpentered hen NUM and the same door NUM
these works were influenced by updikes early engagement with the new yorker
this early work also featured the influence of j d salinger ap john cheever snowing in greenwich village and the modernists marcel proust henry green james joyce and vladimir nabokov 
during this time updike underwent a profound spiritual crisis 
suffering from a loss of religious faith he began reading sren kierkegaard and the theologian karl barth 
both deeply influenced his own religious beliefs which in turn figured prominently in his fiction 
updike remained a believing christian for the rest of his life 
later updike and his family relocated to ipswich massachusetts 
many commentators including a columnist in the local ipswich chronicle asserted that the fictional town of tarbox in couples was based on ipswich 
updike denied the suggestion in a letter to the paper 
impressions of updikes day-to-day life in ipswich during the NUMs and NUMs are included in a letter to the same paper published soon after updikes death and written by a friend and contemporary 
in ipswich updike wrote rabbit run NUM on a guggenheim fellowship and the centaur NUM two of his most acclaimed and famous works the latter won the national book award 
rabbit run featured harry rabbit angstrom a former high school basketball star and middle-class paragon who would become updikes most enduring and critically acclaimed character

rabbit run was featured in times all-time NUM greatest novels 
updikes career and reputation were nurtured and expanded by his long association with the new yorker which published him frequently throughout his career despite the fact that he had departed the magazines employment after only two years 
updikes memoir indicates that he stayed in his corner of new england to give its domestic news with a focus on the american home from the point of view of a male writer 
updikes contract with the magazine gave it right of first offer for his short-story manuscripts but william shawn the new yorkers editor from NUM to NUM rejected several as too explicit 
the maple short stories collected in too far to go NUM reflected the ebb and flow of updikes first marriage separating NUM and here come the maples NUM related to his divorce 
these stories also reflect the role of alcohol in NUMs america 
they were the basis for the television movie also called too far to go broadcast by nbc in NUM

in NUM the library of america issued a two-volume boxed edition of NUM stories under the title the collected stories
in NUM updike published a sequel to rabbit run called rabbit redux his response to the NUMs rabbit reflected much of updikes resentment and hostility towards the social and political changes that beset the united states during that time 
updikes early olinger period was set in the pennsylvania of his youth it ended around NUM with the lyrical of the farm
after his early novels updike became most famous for his chronicling infidelity adultery and marital unrest especially in suburban america and for his controversial depiction of the confusion and freedom inherent in this breakdown of social mores

updike later called rabbit a brother to me and a good friend 
he opened me up as a writer 
after the publication of rabbit at rest updike spent the rest of the NUMs and early NUMs publishing novels in a wide range of genres the work of this period was frequently experimental in nature 
these styles included the historical fiction of memories of the ford administration NUM the magical realism of brazil NUM the science fiction of toward the end of time NUM the postmodernism of gertrude and claudius NUM and the experimental fiction of seek my face NUM
in the midst of these he wrote what was for him a more conventional novel in the beauty of the lilies NUM a historical saga spanning several generations and exploring themes of religion and cinema in america

the new yorker published excerpts of endpoint in its NUM march NUM issue 
much of updikes poetical output was recollected in knopfs collected poems NUM
he wrote that i began as a writer of light verse and have tried to carry over into my serious or lyric verse something of the strictness and liveliness of the lesser form 
the poet thomas m disch noted that because updike was such a well-known novelist his poetry could be mistaken as a hobby or a foible disch saw updikes light verse instead as a poetry of epigrammatical lucidity
his poetry has been praised for its engagement with a variety of forms and topics its wit and precision and for its depiction of topics familiar to american readers 
british poet gavin ewart praised updike for the metaphysical quality of his poetry and for his ability to make the ordinary seem strange and called him one of the few modern novelists capable of writing good poetry 
reading endpoint aloud the critic charles mcgrath claimed that he found another deeper music in updikes poetry finding that updikes wordplay smooths and elides itself and has many subtle sound effects
john keenan who praised the collection endpoint as beautiful and poignant noted that his poetrys engagement with the everyday world in a technically accomplished manner seems to count against him
updike was also a critic of literature and art one frequently cited as one of the best american critics of his generation 
in the introduction to picked-up pieces his NUM collection of prose he listed his personal rules for literary criticism

he reviewed nearly every major writer of the NUMth century and some NUMth-century authors typically in the new yorker always trying to make his reviews animated 
he also championed young writers comparing them to his own literary heroes including vladimir nabokov and marcel proust 
good reviews from updike were often seen as a significant achievement in terms of literary reputation and even sales some of his positive reviews helped jump-start the careers of such younger writers as erica jong thomas mallon and jonathan safran foer 
bad reviews by updike sometimes caused controversy as when in late NUM he gave a damning review of toni morrisons novel a mercy
updike was praised for his literary criticisms conventional simplicity and profundity for being an aestheticist critic who saw literature on its own terms and for his longtime commitment to the practice of literary criticism 
much of updikes art criticism appeared in the new york review of books where he often wrote about american art 
his art criticism involved an aestheticism like that of his literary criticism 
updikes NUM jefferson lecture the clarity of things whats american about american art
 dealt with the uniqueness of american art from the NUMth century to the NUMth 
in the lecture he argued that american art until the expressionist movement of the NUMth century in which america declared its artistic independence is characterized by an insecurity not found in the artistic tradition of europe 
updike is considered one of the greatest american fiction writers of his generation 
he was widely praised as americas last true man of letters with an immense and far-reaching influence on many writers 
the excellence of his prose style is acknowledged even by critics skeptical of other aspects of updikes work 
critics emphasize his inimitable prose style and rich description and language often favorably compared to proust and nabokov 
some critics consider the fluency of his prose to be a fault questioning the intellectual depth and thematic seriousness of his work given the polish of his language and the perceived lightness of his themes while others criticized updike for misogynistic depictions of women and sexual relationships 
other critics argue that updikes dense vocabulary and syntax functions as a distancing technique to mediate the intellectual and emotional involvement of the reader
on the whole however updike is extremely well regarded as a writer who mastered many genres wrote with intellectual vigor and a powerful prose style with shrewd insight into the sorrows frustrations and banality of american life
updikes character rabbit angstrom the protagonist of the series of novels widely considered his magnum opus has been said to have entered the pantheon of signal american literary figures along with huckleberry finn jay gatsby holden caulfield and others 
a NUM list by book magazine of the NUM best fictional characters since NUM listed rabbit in the top five 
the rabbit novels the henry bech stories and the maples stories have been canonized by everymans library 
after updikes death harvards houghton library acquired his papers manuscripts and letters naming the collection the john updike archive

the society will begin publishing the john updike review a journal of critical scholarship in the field of updike studies 
the john updike society first biennial conference took place in NUM at alvernia university 
eulogizing updike in january NUM the british novelist ian mcewan wrote that updikes literary schemes and pretty conceits touched at points on the shakespearean and that updikes death marked the end of the golden age of the american novel in the NUMth centurys second half 
mcewan said the rabbit series is updikes masterpiece and will surely be his monument and concluded
updike is a master of effortless motionbetween third and first person from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic from specific detail to wide generalisation from the actual to the numinous from the scary to the comic 
for his own particular purposes updike devised for himself a style of narration an intense present tense free indirect style that can leap up whenever it wants to a gods-eye view of harry or the view of his put-upon wife janice or victimised son nelson 
this carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory which are more updike than harry and comically sweeping notions of jewry which are more harry than updike 
this is at the heart of the tetralogys achievement 
updike once said of the rabbit books that they were an exercise in point of view 
this was typically self-deprecating but contains an important grain of truth 
harrys education extends no further than high school and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn combative spirit yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar american anxiety failure and prosperity 
a mode had to be devised to make this possible and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism 
in a novel like this updike insisted you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence and not chop them down to what you think is the right size 
jonathan raban highlighting many of the virtues that have been ascribed to updikes prose called rabbit at rest one of the very few modern novels in english .. that one can set beside the work of dickens thackeray george eliot joyce and not feel the draft .
it is a book that works by a steady accumulation of a mass of brilliant details of shades and nuances of the byplay between one sentence and the next and no short review can properly honor its intricacy and richness 
the novelist philip roth considered one of updikes chief literary rivals wrote john updike is our times greatest man of letters as brilliant a literary critic and essayist as he was a novelist and short story writer 
he is and always will be no less a national treasure than his NUMth-century precursor nathaniel hawthorne 
the noted critic james wood called updike a prose writer of great beauty but that prose confronts one with the question of whether beauty is enough and whether beauty always conveys all that a novelist must convey
in a review of licks of love NUM wood concluded that updikes prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons but that there often exists in his work a hard coarse primitive misogynistic worldview
wood both praised and criticized updikes language for having an essayistic saunter the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics and hovers slightly above its subjects generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract
according to wood updike is capable of writing the perfect sentence and his style is characterized by a delicate deferral of the sentence 
of the beauty of updikes language and his faith in the power of that language floats above reality wood wrote for some time now updikes language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer 
updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss 
for all his fabled protestantism both american puritan and lutheran-barthian with its cold glitter its insistence on the aching gap between god and his creatures updike seems less like hawthorne than balzac in his unstopping and limitless energy and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued the very form of the rabbit bookshere extended a further instancesuggests continuance 
updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail uslifes gallant battered ongoingness  indeedand part of the difficulty he has run into late in his career is that he shows no willingness verbally to acknowledge silence failure interruption loss of faith despair and so on 
supremely better than almost any other contemporary writer he can always describe these feelings and states but they are not inscribed in the language itself 
updikes language for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse testifies instead to its own uncanny success to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season 
in direct contrast to woods evaluation the oxford critic thomas karshan asserted that updike is intensely intellectual with a style that constitutes his manner of thought not merely a set of dainty curlicues
karshan calls updike an inheritor of the traditional role of the epic writer
according to karshan updikes writing picks up one voice joins its cadence and moves on to another like rabbit himself driving south through radio zones on his flight away from his wife and child 
disagreeing with woods critique of updikes alleged over-stylization karshan evaluates updikes language as convincingly naturalistic
updikes sentences at their frequent best are not a complacent expression of faith 
rather like prousts sentences in updikes description they seek an essence so fine the search itself is an act of faith 
updike aspires to this sense of self-qualification the kind of timid reverence towards what exists that czanne shows when he grapples for the shape and shade of a fruit through a mist of delicate stabs 
their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles readjust and pass on 
if life is bountiful in new england it is also evasive and easily missed 
in the stories updike tells marriages and homes are made only to be broken 
his descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world 
but love is precarious updike is always saying since it thrives on obstructions and makes them if it cannot find them 
harold bloom once called updike a minor novelist with a major style 
a quite beautiful and very considerable stylist .
he specializes in the easier pleasures 
bloom also edited an important collection of critical essays on updike in NUM in which he concluded that updike possessed a major style and was capable of writing beautiful sentences which are beyond praise nevertheless bloom went on the american sublime will never touch his pages
on the dick cavett show in NUM the novelist and short-story writer john cheever was asked why he did not write book reviews and what he would say if given the chance to review rabbit is rich
he replied

the fiction circus an online and multimedia literary magazine called updike one of the four great american novelists of his time along with philip roth cormac mccarthy and don delillo each jokingly represented as a sign of the zodiac 
furthermore updike was seen as the best prose writer in the world like nabokov before him 
but in contrast to many literati and establishment obituaries the circus asserted that nobody thought of updike as a vital writer 
adam gopnik of the new yorker evaluated updike as the first american writer since henry james to get himself fully expressed the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted american writing .
he sang like henry james but he saw like sinclair lewis 
the two sides of american fictionthe precise realist encyclopedic appetite to get it all in and the exquisite urge to make writing out of sensation rendered exactlywere both alive in him 
the critic james wolcott in a review of updikes last novel the widows of eastwick NUM noted that updikes penchant for observing americas decline is coupled with an affirmation of americas ultimate merits updike elegises entropy american-style with a resigned paternal disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists don delillo gore vidal philip roth 
america may have lost its looks and stature but it was a beauty once and worth every golden dab of sperm 
gore vidal in a controversial essay in the times literary supplement professed to have never taken updike seriously as a writer
he criticizes his political and aesthetic worldview for its blandness and acceptance of authority in any form
he concludes that updike describes to no purpose
in reference to updikes wide establishment acclaim vidal mockingly called him our good child and excoriated his alleged political conservatism 
vidal ultimately concluded updikes work is more and more representative of that polarizing within a state where authority grows ever more brutal and malign while its hired hands in the media grow ever more excited as the holy war of the few against the many heats up 
robert b silvers editor of the new york review of books called updike one of the most elegant and coolly observant writers of his generation
the short-story writer lorrie moore who once described updike as american literatures greatest short story writer .. and arguably our greatest writer reviewed updikes body of short stories in the new york review praising their intricate detail and rich imagery his eye and his prose never falter even when the world fails to send its more socially complicated revelations directly his storys way
in a post commemorating his birthday in NUM blogger and literary critic christy potter called updike ...the writer the kind of writer everyone has heard of the one whose name you can bring up at a party and people who have never read one thing he wrote will still nod their heads knowingly and say oh yes john updike 
the writer 
during november NUM the editors of the uks literary review magazine awarded updike their bad sex in fiction lifetime achievement award which celebrates crude tasteless or ridiculous sexual passages in modern literature
the principal themes in updikes work are religion sex and america as well as death 
often he would combine them frequently in his favored terrain of the american small town protestant middle class of which he once said i like middles 
it is in middles that extremes clash where ambiguity restlessly rules 
for example the decline of religion in america is chronicled in in the beauty of the lilies NUM alongside the history of cinema and rabbit angstrom contemplates the merits of sex with the wife of his friend reverend jack eccles while the latter is giving his sermon in rabbit run NUM
critics have often noted that updike imbued language itself with a kind of faith in its efficacy and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and booksthe rabbit series the henry bech series eastwick the maples storiesdemonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language 
updikes novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course 
rabbit angstrom himself acts as a kierkegaardian knight of faith 
describing his purpose in writing prose updike himself in the introduction to his early stories NUM NUM wrote that his aim was always to give the mundane its beautiful due 
elsewhere he famously said when i write i aim my mind not towards new york but towards a vague spot east of kansas 
some have suggested that the best statement of updikes aesthetic comes in his early memoir the dogwood tree NUM blankness is not emptiness we may skate upon an intense radiance we do not see because we see nothing else 
and in fact there is a color a quiet but tireless goodness that things at rest like a brick wall or a small stone seem to affirm 
sex in updikes work is noted for its ubiquity and the reverence with which he described it
the critic edward champion notes that updikes prose heavily favors external sexual imagery rife with explicit anatomical detail rather than descriptions of internal emotion in descriptions of sex 
in champions interview with updike on the bat segundo show updike replied that he perhaps favored such imagery to concretize and make sex real in his prose 
another sexual theme commonly addressed in updike is adultery especially in a suburban middle class setting most famously in couples NUM
the updikean narrator is often a man guilty of infidelity and abandonment of his family 
similarly updike wrote about america with a certain nostalgia reverence and recognition and celebration of americas broad diversity 
zz packer wrote that in updike there seemed a strange ability to harken both america the beautiful as well as america the plain jane and the lovely protestant backbone in his fiction and essays when he decided to show it off was as progressive and enlightened as it was unapologetic 
the rabbit novels in particular can be viewed according to julian barnes as a distraction from and a glittering confirmation of the vast bustling ordinariness of american life 
but as updike celebrated ordinary america he also alluded to its decline at times he was so clearly disturbed by the downward spin of america 
adam gopnik concludes that updikes great subject was the american attempt to fill the gap left by faith with the materials produced by mass culture 
he documented how the death of a credible religious belief has been offset by sex and adultery and movies and sports and toyotas and family love and family obligation 
for updike this effort was blessed and very nearly successful 
updikes novels about america almost always contain references to political events of the time 
in this sense they are artifacts of their historical eras showing how national leaders shape and define their times 
the lives of ordinary citizens take place against this wider background 
updike often wrote about death his characters providing a mosaic of reactions to mortality ranging from terror to attempts at insulation 
in the poorhouse fair NUM the elderly john hook intones there is no goodness without belief .. and if you have not believed at the end of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved to take into the next demonstrating a religious metaphysical faith present in much of updikes work 
for rabbit angstrom with his constant musings on mortality his near-witnessing of his daughters death and his often shaky faith death is more frightening and less obvious in its ramifications 
at the end of rabbit at rest NUM though rabbit demonstrates a kind of certainty telling his son nelson on his deathbed ...but enough 
maybe 
enough 
in the centaur NUM george caldwell has no religious faith and is afraid of his cancer 
death can also be a sort of unseen terror it occurs offstage but reverberates for survivors as an absent presence 
updike himself also experienced a crisis over the afterlife and indeed many of his heroes shared the same sort of existential fears the author acknowledged he had suffered as a young man henry bechs concern that he was a fleck of dust condemned to know it is a fleck of dust or colonel ellellos lament that we will be forgotten all of us forgotten 
their fear of death threatens to make everything they do feel meaningless and it also sends them running after godlooking for some reassurance that there is something beyond the familiar everyday world with its signals and buildings and cars and bricks 
updike demonstrated his own fear in some of his more personal writings including the poem perfection wasted NUM

ricketts had taken a college class from warder clyde allee a biologist and ecological theorist who would go on to write a classic early textbook on ecology

in presenting the NUM nobel prize to steinbeck the swedish academy cited spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos asocial individuals who in their wild revels are almost caricatures of king arthurs knights of the round table 
it has been said that in the united states this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression 
tortilla flat was adapted as a NUM film of the same name starring spencer tracy hedy lamarr and john garfield a friend of steinbeck

it is completely out of hand i mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy

the book has a very different tone from steinbecks amoral and ecological stance in earlier works like tortilla flat and cannery row
it was not a critical success 
many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel but were disappointed that it was not another grapes of wrath

in NUM steinbeck won the nobel prize for literature for his realistic and imaginative writing combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception 
the selection was heavily criticized and described as one of the academys biggest mistakes in one swedish newspaper 
the reaction of american literary critics was also harsh 
the new york times asked why the nobel committee gave the award to an author whose limited talent is in his best books watered down by tenth-rate philosophising noting that the international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the nobel committee is to the main currents of american writing .. we think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer  .. whose significance influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age
steinbeck when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the nobel replied frankly no 
biographer jackson benson notes this honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver 
it was precisely because the committee made its judgment  .. on its own criteria rather than plugging into the main currents of american writing as defined by the critical establishment that the award had value 
in his acceptance speech later in the year in stockholm he said
in NUM NUM years later the nobel prize opened its archives and it was revealed that steinbeck was a compromise choice among a shortlist consisting of steinbeck british authors robert graves and lawrence durrell french dramatist jean anouilh and danish author karen blixen 
the declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot 
there arent any obvious candidates for the nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation wrote committee member henry olsson 
although the committee believed steinbecks best work was behind him by NUM committee member anders sterling believed the release of his novel the winter of our discontent showed that after some signs of slowing down in recent years steinbeck has regained his position as a social truth-teller and is an authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors sinclair lewis and ernest hemingway

he had written to his doctor that he felt deeply in his flesh that he would not survive his physical death and that the biological end of his life was the final end to it 
the day after steinbecks death in new york city reviewer charles poore wrote in the new york times john steinbecks first great book was his last great book 
but good lord what a book that was and is the grapes of wrath.
poore noted a preachiness in steinbecks work as if half his literary inheritance came from the best of mark twain and the other half from the worst of cotton mather 
but he asserted that steinbeck didnt need the nobel prize the nobel judges needed him 
steinbecks incomplete novel based on the king arthur legends of malory and others the acts of king arthur and his noble knights was published in NUM

that claimed steinbeck was undeserving of the prestigious prize as he was a limited talent whose works were watered down by tenth-rate philosophizing
many american critics now consider these attacks to be politically motivated 
the british newspaper the guardian in a NUM article that revealed that steinbeck had been a compromise choice for the nobel prize called him a giant of american letters
despite ongoing attacks on his literary reputation steinbecks works continue to sell well and he is widely taught in american and british schools as a bridge to more complex literature 
works such as of mice and men are short and easy to read and compassionately illustrate universal themes that are still relevant in the NUMst century 
steinbeck grew up in californias salinas valley a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history 
this upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing giving many of his works a distinct sense of place 
salinas monterey and parts of the san joaquin valley were the setting for many of his stories 
the area is now sometimes referred to as steinbeck country
most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years 
an exception was his first novel  which concerns the pirate henry morgan whose adventures had captured steinbecks imagination as a child 
in his subsequent novels steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in california 
his childhood friend max wagner a brother of jack wagner and who later became a film actor served as inspiration for the red pony
later he used actual american conditions and events in the first half of the NUMth century which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter 
steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the dust bowl and the great depression 
his later work reflected his wide range of interests including marine biology politics religion history and mythology 
one of his last published works was travels with charley a travelogue of a road trip he took in NUM to rediscover america 
steinbecks boyhood home a turreted victorian building in downtown salinas has been preserved and restored by the valley guild a nonprofit organization

his fathers cottage on eleventh street in pacific grove where steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books also survives 
in monterey ed ricketts laboratory survives though it is not yet open to the public and at the corner which steinbeck describes in cannery row also the store which once belonged to lee chong and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hobos of cannery row 
the site of the hovden sardine cannery next to docs laboratory is now occupied by the monterey bay aquarium 
the street that steinbeck described as cannery row in the novel once named ocean view avenue was renamed cannery row in honor of the novel in NUM
the town of monterey has commemorated steinbecks work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from cannery row historical plaques and sculptured busts depicting steinbeck and ricketts 
on february NUM NUM the NUMth anniversary of the writers birth the united states postal service issued a stamp featuring steinbeck starting the postal services literary arts series honoring american writers

steinbeck and his friend ed ricketts appear as a fictionalized characters in the NUM novel monterey bay about the founding of the monterey bay aquarium by lindsay hatton penguin press
steinbeck was affiliated to the st pauls episcopal church and he stayed attached throughout his life to episcopalianism 
especially in his works of fiction steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes 
the shaping of his characters often drew on the bible and the theology of the church of england combining elements of roman catholicism and protestantism 
steinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left salinas for stanford 
however the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at salinas and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work 
his episcopalian views are prominently displayed in the grapes of wrath in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters casy and tom who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion 
steinbecks contacts with leftist authors journalists and labor union figures may have influenced his writing 
he joined the league of american writers a communist organization in NUM

in june NUM steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by supporting him when miller refused to name names in the house un-american activities committee trials 
steinbeck called the period one of the strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced 
in NUM when he was sent to vietnam to report on the war his sympathetic portrayal of the united states army led the new york post to denounce him for betraying his liberal past 
steinbecks biographer jay parini says steinbecks friendship with president lyndon b johnson influenced his views on vietnam 
steinbeck may also have been concerned about the safety of his son serving in vietnam 
steinbeck complained publicly about government harassment 
thomas steinbeck the authors eldest son said that j edgar hoover director of the fbi at the time could find no basis for prosecuting steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the us internal revenue service to audit steinbecks taxes every single year of his life just to annoy him 
according to thomas a true artist is one who without a thought for self stands up against the stones of condemnation and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice or the halls of government 
by doing so these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo 
in a NUM letter to united states attorney general francis biddle john steinbeck wrote do you suppose you could ask edgars boys to stop stepping on my heels
they think i am an enemy alien 
it is getting tiresome 
the fbi denied that steinbeck was under investigation 
in NUM steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his dustbowl trilogy which included of mice and men and the grapes of wrath
this first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers strike in california which is both aided and damaged by the help of the party generally taken to be the communist party although this is never spelled out in the book 
of mice and men is a tragedy that was written as a play in NUM

the grapes of wrath is set in the great depression and describes a family of sharecroppers the joads who were driven from their land due to the dust storms of the dust bowl 
the title is a reference to the battle hymn of the republic 
some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers plight and too critical of capitalism but found a large audience of its own 
it won both the national book award and pulitzer prize for fiction novels and was adapted as a film starring henry fonda and jane darwell and directed by john ford 
steinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this salinas valley saga 
the story follows two families the hamiltons based on steinbecks own maternal ancestry and the trasks reprising stories about the biblical adam and his progeny 
the book was published in NUM
it was made into a NUM movie directed by elia kazan and starring james dean 
in NUM steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom-built camper top which was rare at the time and drove across the united states with his faithful blue standard poodle charley 
steinbeck nicknamed his truck rocinante after don quixotes noble steed
in this sometimes comical sometimes melancholic book steinbeck describes what he sees from maine to montana to california and from there to texas and louisiana and back to his home on long island 
the restored camper truck is on exhibit in the national steinbeck center in salinas

at age NUM kirby enrolled at the pratt institute in brooklyn leaving after a week 
i wasnt the kind of student that pratt was looking for

i intended to get things done
kirby joined the lincoln newspaper syndicate in NUM working there on newspaper comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons such as your health comes first
under the pseudonym jack curtiss
he remained until late NUM when he began working for the movie animation company fleischer studios as an inbetweener an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames on popeye cartoons 
i went from lincoln to fleischer he recalled 
from fleischer i had to get out in a hurry because i couldnt take that kind of thing describing it as a factory in a sense like my fathers factory 
they were manufacturing pictures 
around that time the american comic book industry was booming

i was delighted and i took him over to my little office 
we worked from the second issue of blue bolt through .. about NUM years 
after leaving sun and landing at pulp magazine publisher martin goodmans timely comics later to become marvel comics simon and kirby created the patriotic superhero captain america in late NUM
simon who became the companys editor with kirby as art director said he negotiated with goodman to give the duo NUM percent of the profits from the feature 
the first issue of captain america comics released in early NUM sold out in days and the second issues print run was set at over a million copies 
the titles success established the team as a notable creative force in the industry 
after the first issue was published simon asked kirby to join the timely staff as the companys art director 
with the success of the captain america character simon said he felt that goodman was not paying the pair the promised percentage of profits and so sought work for the two of them at national comics publications later renamed dc comics
kirby and simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined NUM a week as opposed to the NUM and NUM they respectively earned at timely 
the pair feared goodman would not pay them if he found they were moving to national but many people knew of their plan including timely editorial assistant stan lee 
when goodman eventually discovered it he told simon and kirby to leave after finishing work on captain america comics NUM
kirby and simon spent their first weeks at national trying to devise new characters while the company sought how best to utilize the pair

the couple had four children together susan b december NUM NUM neal b 
may NUM barbara b november NUM and lisa b september NUM

kirby was drafted into the us army on june NUM NUM
after basic training at camp stewart near savannah georgia he was assigned to company f of the NUMth infantry regiment 
he landed on omaha beach in normandy on august NUM NUM two-and-a-half months after d-day although kirbys reminiscences would place his arrival just NUM days after

the team found its greatest success in the postwar period by creating romance comics 
simon inspired by macfadden publications romantic-confession magazine true story transplanted the idea to comic books and with kirby created a first-issue mock-up of young romance
showing it to crestwood general manager maurice rosenfeld simon asked for NUM of the comics profits 
crestwood publishers teddy epstein and mike bleier agreed stipulating that the creators would take no money up front 
young romance NUM cover-date oct NUM became jack and joes biggest hit in years
the pioneering title sold a staggering NUM of its print run inspiring crestwood to increase the print run by the third issue to triple the initial number of copies 
initially published bimonthly young romance quickly became a monthly title and produced the spin-off young lovetogether the two titles sold two million copies per month according to simonlater joined by young brides and in love the latter featuring full-length romance stories
young romance spawned dozens of imitators from publishers such as timely fawcett quality and fox feature syndicate 
despite the glut the simon and kirby romance titles continued to sell millions of copies a month which allowed kirby to buy a house for his family in mineola in NUM which would be the familys home for the next NUM years working out of a basement studio NUM feet in width which the family referred to as the dungeon
bitter that timely comics NUMs iteration atlas comics had relaunched captain america in a new series in NUM kirby and simon created fighting american
simon recalled we thought wed show them how to do captain america
while the comic book initially portrayed the protagonist as an anti-communist dramatic hero simon and kirby turned the series into a superhero satire with the second issue in the aftermath of the army-mccarthy hearings and the public backlash against the red-baiting us 
senator joseph mccarthy 
at the urging of a crestwood salesman kirby and simon launched their own comics company mainline publications securing a distribution deal with leader news in late NUM or early NUM subletting space from their friend al harveys harvey publications at NUM broadway 
mainline which existed from NUM to NUM published four titles the western bullseye western scout the war comic foxhole because ec comics and atlas comics were having success with war comics but promoting theirs as being written and drawn by actual veterans in love because their earlier romance comic young love was still being widely imitated and the crime comic police trap which claimed to be based on genuine accounts by law-enforcement officials 
after the duo rearranged and republished artwork from an old crestwood story in in love crestwood refused to pay the team who sought an audit of crestwoods finances 
upon review the pairs attorneys stated the company owed them NUM for work done over the past seven years 
crestwood paid them NUM in addition to their recent delayed payments 
the partnership between kirby and simon had become strained 
simon left the industry for a career in advertising while kirby continued to freelance 
he wanted to do other things and i stuck with comics kirby recalled in NUM
it was fine 
there was no reason to continue the partnership and we parted friends 
at this point in the mid-NUMs kirby made a temporary return to the former timely comics now known as atlas comics the direct predecessor of marvel comics 
inker frank giacoia had approached editor-in-chief stan lee for work and suggested he could get kirby back here to pencil some stuff 
while freelancing for national comics publications the future dc comics kirby drew NUM stories for atlas from NUM to NUM beginning with the five-page mine field in battleground NUM nov NUM kirby penciled and in some cases inked with his wife roz and wrote stories of the western hero black rider the fu manchu-like yellow claw and more 
but in NUM distribution troubles caused the atlas implosion that resulted in several series being dropped and no new material being assigned for many months 
it would be the following year before kirby returned to the nascent marvel 
for dc around this time kirby co-created with writers dick and dave wood the non-superpowered adventuring quartet the challengers of the unknown in showcase NUM feb NUM while contributing to such anthologies as house of mystery
during NUM months freelancing for dc kirby drew slightly more than NUM pages which included NUM six-page green arrow stories in worlds finest comics and adventure comics that in a rarity kirby inked himself 
kirby recast the archer as a science-fiction hero moving him away from his batman-formula roots but in the process alienating green arrow co-creator mort weisinger 
he began drawing sky masters of the space force a newspaper comic strip written by the wood brothers and initially inked by the unrelated wally wood 
kirby left national comics publications due largely to a contractual dispute in which editor jack schiff who had been involved in getting kirby and the wood brothers the sky masters contract claimed he was due royalties from kirbys share of the strips profits 
schiff successfully sued kirby 
some dc editors had criticized him over art details such as not drawing the shoelaces on a cavalrymans boots and showing a native american mounting his horse from the wrong side 
several months later after his split with dc kirby began freelancing regularly for atlas despite harboring negative sentiments about lee the cousin of timely publisher martin goodmans wife whom kirby believed had disclosed to timely back in the NUMs that he and simon were secretly working on a project for national 
because of the poor page rates kirby would spend NUM to NUM hours daily at his drawing table at home producing four to five pages of artwork a day 
his first published work at atlas was the cover of and the seven-page story i discovered the secret of the flying saucers in strange worlds NUM dec NUM
initially with christopher rule as his regular inker and later dick ayers kirby drew across all genres from romance comics to war comics to crime comics to western comics but made his mark primarily with a series of supernatural-fantasy and science fiction stories featuring giant drive-in movie-style monsters with names like groot the thing from planet x grottu king of the insects and fin fang foom for the companys many anthology series such as amazing adventures strange tales tales to astonish tales of suspense and world of fantasy 
his bizarre designs of powerful unearthly creatures proved a hit with readers 
additionally he freelanced for archie comics around this time reuniting briefly with joe simon to help develop the series the fly and the double life of private strong
additionally kirby drew some issues of classics illustrated
it was at marvel in collaborating with writer and editor-in-chief lee that kirby hit his stride once again in superhero comics beginning with the fantastic four NUM nov NUM
the landmark series became a hit that revolutionized the industry with its comparative naturalism and eventually a cosmic purview informed by kirbys seemingly boundless imaginationone well-matched with the consciousness-expanding youth culture of the NUMs 
for almost a decade kirby provided marvels house style co-creating with stan lee many of the marvel characters and designing their visual motifs 
at lees request he often provided new-to-marvel artists breakdown layouts over which they would pencil in order to become acquainted with the marvel look 
as artist gil kane described
highlights of leekirby collaborations other than the fantastic four include the hulk thor iron man the original x-men doctor doom uatu the watcher magneto ego the living planet the inhumans and their hidden city of attilan and the black panther comics first known black superheroand his african nation of wakanda 
kirby drew the first spider-man story intended for publication in amazing fantasy NUM but stan lee chose to have steve ditko redraw the story 
lee and kirby gathered several of their newly created characters together into the team title the avengers and would revive characters from the NUMs such as the sub-mariner captain america and ka-zar 
the story frequently cited as lee and kirbys finest achievement is the three-part the galactus trilogy that began in fantastic four NUM march NUM chronicling the arrival of galactus a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet and his herald the silver surfer 
fantastic four NUM was chosen as NUM in the NUM greatest marvels of all time poll of marvels readers in NUM
editor robert greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that as the fourth year of the fantastic four came to a close stan lee and jack kirby seemed to be only warming up 
in retrospect it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the marvel age 
comics historian les daniels noted that the mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the NUMs and lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses 
in NUM and NUM joe simon was involved in litigation with marvel comics over the ownership of captain america initiated by marvel after simon registered the copyright renewal for captain america in his own name 
according to simon kirby agreed to support the company in the litigation and as part of a deal kirby made with publisher martin goodman signed over to marvel any rights he might have had to the character 
kirby continued to expand the mediums boundaries devising photo-collage covers and interiors developing new drawing techniques such as the method for depicting energy fields now known as kirby krackle and other experiments 
kirby grew increasingly dissatisfied with working at marvel 
there have been a number of reasons given for this dissatisfaction including resentment over stan lees increasing media prominence a lack of full creative control anger over breaches of perceived promises by publisher martin goodman and frustration over marvels failure to credit him specifically for his story plotting and for his character creations and co-creations 
he began to both script and draw some secondary features for marvel such as the inhumans in amazing adventures as well as horror stories for the anthology title chamber of darkness and received full credit for doing so but in NUM kirby was presented with a contract that included such unfavorable terms as a prohibition against legal retaliation 
when kirby objected the management refused to negotiate any contract changes 
kirby although he was earning NUM a year freelancing for the company subsequently left marvel in NUM for rival dc comics under editorial director carmine infantino 
kirby spent nearly two years negotiating a deal to move to dc comics where in late NUM he signed a three-year contract with an option for two additional years 
he produced a series of interlinked titles under the blanket sobriquet the fourth world which included a trilogy of new titles new gods mister miracle and the forever people as well as the extant supermans pal jimmy olsen 
kirby picked the latter book because the series was without a stable creative team and he did not want to cost anyone a job 
the central villain of the fourth world series darkseid and some of the fourth world concepts appeared in jimmy olsen before the launch of the other fourth world books giving the new titles greater exposure to potential buyers 
the superman figures and jimmy olsen faces drawn by kirby were redrawn by al plastino and later by murphy anderson 
les daniels observed in NUM that kirbys mix of slang and myth science fiction and the bible made for a heady brew but the scope of his vision has endured 
in NUM comics writer grant morrison commented that kirbys dramas were staged across jungian vistas of raw symbol and storm ..the fourth world saga crackles with the voltage of jack kirbys boundless imagination let loose onto paper 
an attempt at creating new formats for comics produced the one-shot black-and-white magazines spirit world and in the days of the mob in NUM
kirby later produced other dc series such as omac kamandi the demon and kobra and worked on such extant features as the losers in our fighting forces
together with former partner joe simon for one last time he worked on a new incarnation of the sandman 
kirby produced three issues of the NUMst issue special anthology series and created atlas the great a new manhunter and the dingbats of danger street 
kirbys production assistant of the time mark evanier recounted that dcs policies of the era were not in synch with kirbys creative impulses and that he was often forced to work on characters and projects he did not like 
meanwhile some artists at dc did not want kirby there as he threatened their positions in the company they also had bad blood from previous competition with marvel and legal problems with him 
since he was working from california they were able to undermine his work through redesigns in the new york office 
at the comic book convention marvelcon NUM in NUM stan lee used a fantastic four panel discussion to announce that kirby was returning to marvel after having left in NUM to work for dc comics 
lee wrote in his monthly column stan lees soapbox i mentioned that i had a special announcement to make 
as i started telling about jacks return to a totally incredulous audience everyones head started to snap around as kirby himself came waltzin down the aisle to join us on the rostrum
you can imagine how it felt clownin around with the co-creator of most of marvels greatest strips once more 
back at marvel kirby both wrote and drew the monthly captain america series as well as the captain americas bicentennial battles one-shot in the oversized treasury format 
he created the series the eternals which featured a race of inscrutable alien giants the celestials whose behind-the-scenes intervention in primordial humanity would eventually become a core element of marvel universe continuity 
he produced an adaptation and expansion of the film  as well as an abortive attempt to do the same for the classic television series the prisoner
he wrote and drew black panther and drew numerous covers across the line 
kirbys other marvel creations in this period include machine man and devil dinosaur
kirbys final comics collaboration with stan lee the silver surfer the ultimate cosmic experience was published in NUM as part of the marvel fireside books series and is considered marvels first graphic novel 
still dissatisfied with marvels treatment of him and with an offer of employment from hanna-barbera kirby left marvel to work in animation 
in that field he did designs for turbo teen thundarr the barbarian and other animated series for television 
he worked on the new fantastic four animated series reuniting him with scriptwriter stan lee 
he illustrated an adaptation of the walt disney movie the black hole for walt disneys treasury of classic tales syndicated comic strip in NUM-NUM
in NUM kirby drew concept art for film producer barry gellers script treatment adapting roger zelaznys science fiction novel lord of light for which geller had purchased the rights 
in collaboration geller commissioned kirby to draw set designs that would be used as architectural renderings for a colorado theme park to be called science fiction land geller announced his plans at a november press conference attended by kirby former american football star rosey grier writer ray bradbury and others 
while the film did not come to fruition kirbys drawings were used for the cias canadian caper in which some members of the us embassy in tehran iran who had avoided capture in the iran hostage crisis were able to escape the country posing as members of a movie location-scouting crew 
in the early NUMs pacific comics a new non-newsstand comic book publisher made a groundbreaking deal with kirby to publish a creator-owned series captain victory and the galactic rangers and the six-issue miniseries silver star later collected in hardcover format in NUM
this together with similar actions by other independent comics publishers as eclipse comics where kirby co-created destroyer duck in a benefit comic-book series published to help steve gerber fight a legal case against marvel helped establish a precedent to end the monopoly of the work for hire system wherein comics creators even freelancers had owned no rights to characters they created 
kirby continued to do periodic work for dc comics during the NUMs including a brief revival of his fourth world saga in the NUM and NUM super powers miniseries and the NUM graphic novel the hunger dogs
dc executives jenette kahn and paul levitz had kirby re-design the fourth world characters for the super powers toyline as a way of entitling him to royalties for several of his dc creations 
in NUM kirby helped to create the concept and designs for the centurions along with gil kane 
a comic book series based on the show was published by dc and a toy line produced by kenner 
in the twilight of his life kirby spent a great deal of time sparring with marvel executives over the ownership rights of original artwork 
at marvel many of these pages owned by the company due to outdated and legally dubious copyright claims were given away as promotional gifts to marvel clients or simply stolen from company warehouses 
after the passage of the copyright act of NUM which greatly expanded artist copyright capabilities comics publishers began to return original art to creators but only if they signed a release reaffirming marvels ownership of the copyright 
in NUM marvel issued a release that demanded kirby affirm that his art was created for hire allowing marvel to retain copyright in perpetuity in addition to demanding that kirby forego all future royalties 
marvel offered him NUM pages of his art less than NUM of his total output if he signed the agreement but reserved the right to reclaim the art if kirby violated the deal 
after kirby publicly slammed marvel calling the company thugs and claiming they were arbitrarily holding his creations marvel finally returned after two years of deliberations approximately NUM or NUM pages of the estimated NUM to NUM kirby drew for the company 
kirby retained ownership of characters used by topps comics beginning in NUM for a set of series in what the company dubbed the kirbyverse
these titles were derived mainly from designs and concepts that kirby had kept in his files some intended initially for the by-then-defunct pacific comics and then licensed to topps for what would become the jack kirbys secret city saga mythos

moby-dick

moby-dick or the whale is an NUM novel by american writer herman melville 
the book is sailor ishmaels narrative of the obsessive quest of ahab captain of the whaling ship pequod for revenge on moby dick the white whale that on the ships previous voyage bit off ahabs leg at the knee 
a contribution to the literature of the american renaissance the works genre classifications range from late romantic to early symbolist 
moby-dick was published to mixed reviews was a commercial failure and was out of print at the time of the authors death in NUM
its reputation as a great american novel was established only in the NUMth century after the centennial of its authors birth 
william faulkner confessed he wished he had written the book himself and d h lawrence called it one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world and the greatest book of the sea ever written
its opening sentence call me ishmael is among world literatures most famous 
melville began writing moby-dick in february NUM and would eventually take NUM months to write the book a full year more than he had first anticipated 
writing was interrupted by his making the acquaintance of nathaniel hawthorne in august NUM and by the creation of the mosses from an old manse essay as a first result of that friendship 
the book is dedicated to hawthorne in token of my admiration for his genius
the basis for the work is melvilles NUM whaling voyage aboard the acushnet
the novel also draws on whaling literature and on literary inspirations such as shakespeare and the bible 
the white whale is modeled on the notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale mocha dick and the books ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship essex in NUM
the detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew are mixed with exploration of class and social status good and evil and the existence of god 
in addition to narrative prose melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs poetry and catalogs to shakespearean stage directions soliloquies and asides 
in october NUM the chapter the town hos story was published in harpers new monthly magazine
the same month the whole book was first published in three volumes as the whale in london and under its definitive title in a single-volume edition in new york in november 
there are hundreds of differences between the two editions most slight but some important and illuminating 
the london publisher richard bentley censored or changed sensitive passages melville made revisions as well including a last-minute change to the title for the new york edition 
the whale however appears in the text of both editions as moby dick without the hyphen 
one factor that led british reviewers to scorn the book was that it seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship the british edition lacked the epilogue which recounts ishmaels survival 
about NUM copies were sold during the authors life 
ishmael travels in december from manhattan island to new bedford with plans to sign up for a whaling voyage 
the inn where he arrives is overcrowded so he must share a bed with the tattooed polynesian queequeg a harpooneer whose father was king of the fictional island of rokovoko 
the next morning ishmael and queequeg attend father mapples sermon on jonah then head for nantucket 
ishmael signs up with the quaker ship-owners bildad and peleg for a voyage on their whaler pequod
peleg describes captain ahab hes a grand ungodly god-like man who nevertheless has his humanities
they hire queequeg the following morning 
a man named elijah prophesies a dire fate should ishmael and queequeg join ahab 
while provisions are loaded shadowy figures board the ship 
on a cold christmas day the pequod leaves the harbor 
ishmael discusses cetology the zoological classification and natural history of the whale and describes the crew members 
the chief mate is NUM-year-old starbuck a nantucket quaker with a realist mentality whose harpooneer is queequeg second mate is stubb from cape cod happy-go-lucky and cheerful whose harpooneer is tashtego a proud pure-blooded indian from gay head and the third mate is flask also from marthas vineyard short stout whose harpooneer is daggoo a tall african now a resident of nantucket 
when ahab finally appears on the quarterdeck he announces he is out for revenge on the white whale which took one leg from the knee down and left him with a prosthesis fashioned from a whales jawbone 
ahab will give the first man to sight moby dick a doubloon a gold coin which he nails to the mast 
starbuck objects that he has not come for vengeance but for profit 
ahabs purpose exercises a mysterious spell on ishmael ahabs quenchless feud seemed mine
instead of rounding cape horn ahab heads for the equatorial pacific ocean via southern africa 
one afternoon as ishmael and queequeg are weaving a mat  its warp seemed necessity his hand free will and queequegs sword chance  tashtego sights a sperm whale 
five previously unknown men appear on deck and are revealed to be a special crew selected by ahab 
their leader fedallah a parsee is ahabs harpooneer 
the pursuit is unsuccessful 
southeast of the cape of good hope the pequod makes the first of nine sea-encounters or gams with other ships ahab hails the goney albatross to ask whether they have seen the white whale but the trumpet through which her captain tries to speak falls into the sea before he can answer 
ishmael explains that because of ahabs absorption with moby dick he sails on without the customary gam which defines as a social meeting of two or more whale-ships in which the two captains remain on one ship and the chief mates on the other 
in the second gam off the cape of good hope with the town-ho a nantucket whaler the concealed story of a judgment of god is revealed but only to the crew a defiant sailor who struck an oppressive officer is flogged and when that officer led the chase for moby dick he fell from the boat and was killed by the whale 
ishmael digresses on pictures of whales brit microscopic sea creatures on which whales feed squid and after four boats lowered in vain because daggoo mistook a giant squid for the white whale whale-lines 
the next day in the indian ocean stubb kills a sperm whale and that night fleece the pequods black cook prepares him a rare whale steak 
fleece delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whales carcass tied to the ship saying that their nature is to be voracious but they must overcome it 
the whale is prepared beheaded and barrels of oil are tried out 
standing at the head of the whale ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea 
the pequod next encounters the jeroboam which not only lost its chief mate to moby dick but also is now plagued by an epidemic 
the whale carcass still lies in the water 
queequeg mounts it tied to ishmaels belt by a monkey-rope as if they were siamese twins 
stubb and flask kill a right whale whose head is fastened to a yardarm opposite the sperm whales head 
ishmael compares the two heads in a philosophical way the right whale is lockean stoic and the sperm whale as kantean platonic 
tashtego cuts into the head of the sperm whale and retrieves buckets of oil 
he falls into the head and the head falls off the yardarm into the sea 
queequeg dives after him and frees his mate with his sword 
the pequod next gams with the jungfrau from bremen 
both ships sight whales simultaneously with the pequod winning the contest 
the three harpooneers dart their harpoons and flask delivers the mortal strike with a lance 
the carcass sinks and queequeg barely manages to escape 
the pequods next gam is with the french whaler bouton de rose whose crew is ignorant of the ambergris in the gut of the diseased whale in their possession 
stubb talks them out of it but ahab orders him away 
days later an encounter with a harpooned whale prompts pip a little black cabin-boy from alabama to jump out of his whale boat 
the whale must be cut loose because the line has pip so entangled in it 
furious stubb orders pip to stay in the whale boat but pip later jumps again and is left alone in the immense sea and has gone insane by the time he is picked up 
cooled sperm oil congeals and must be squeezed back into liquid state blubber is boiled in the try-pots on deck the warm oil is decanted into casks and then stowed in the ship 
after the operation the decks are scrubbed 
the coin hammered to the main mast shows three andes summits one with a flame one with a tower and one a crowing cock 
ahab stops to look at the doubloon and interprets the coin as signs of his firmness volcanic energy and victory starbuck takes the high peaks as evidence of the trinity stubb focuses on the zodiacal arch over the mountains and flask sees nothing of any symbolic value at all 
the manxman mutters in front of the mast and pip declines the verb look
the pequod next gams with the samuel enderby of london captained by boomer a down-to-earth fellow who lost his right arm to moby dick 
nevertheless he carries no ill will toward the whale which he regards not as malicious but as awkward 
ahab puts an end to the gam by rushing back to his ship 
the narrator now discusses the subjects of NUM whalers supply NUM a glen in tranque in the arsacides islands full of carved whale bones fossil whales whale skeleton measurements NUM the chance that the magnitude of the whale will diminish and that the leviathan might perish 
leaving the samuel enderby ahab wrenches his ivory leg and orders the carpenter to fashion him another 
starbuck informs ahab of oil leakage in the hold 
reluctantly ahab orders the harpooneers to inspect the casks 
queequeg sweating all day below decks develops a chill and soon is almost mortally feverish 
the carpenter makes a coffin for queequeg who fears an ordinary burial at sea 
queequeg tries it for size with pip sobbing and beating his tambourine standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises queequeg for his gameness 
yet queequeg suddenly rallies briefly convalesces and leaps up back in good health 
henceforth he uses his coffin for a spare seachest which is later caulked and pitched to replace the pequods life buoy 
the pequod sails northeast toward formosa and into the pacific ocean 
ahab with one nostril smells the musk from the bashee isles and with the other the salt of the waters where moby dick swims 
ahab goes to perth the blacksmith with bag of racehorse shoenail stubs to be forged into the shank of a special harpoon and with his razors for perth to melt and fashion into a harpoon barb 
ahab tempers the barb in blood from queequeg tashtego and daggoo 
the pequod gams next with the bachelor a nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil 
every now and then the pequod lowers for whales with success 
on one of those nights in the whaleboat fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be ahabs that before he dies ahab must see two hearses  one not made by mortal hands and the other made of american wood  that fedallah will precede his captain in death and finally that only hemp can kill ahab 
as the pequod approaches the equator ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only where he is and not where he will be 
he dashes it to the deck 
that evening an impressive typhoon attacks the ship 
lightning strikes the mast setting the doubloon and ahabs harpoon aglow 
ahab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire seeing the lightning as a portent of moby dick 
starbuck sees the lightning as a warning and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping ahab with a musket 
next morning when he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass ahab makes a new one out of a lance a maul and a sailmakers needle 
he orders the log be heaved but the weathered line snaps leaving the ship with no way to fix its location 
the pequod is now heading southeast toward moby dick 
a man falls overboard from the mast 
the life buoy is thrown but both sink 
now queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin be used as a new life buoy 
starbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and caulked 
next morning the ship meets in another truncated gam with the rachel commanded by captain gardiner from nantucket 
the rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after moby dick 
among the missing is gardiners young son 
ahab refuses to join the search 
twenty-four hours a day ahab now stands and walks the deck while fedallah shadows him 
suddenly a sea hawk grabs ahabs slouched hat and flies off with it 
next the pequod in a ninth and final gam meets the delight badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by moby dick 
her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged but ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward 
ahab shares a moment of contemplation with starbuck 
ahab speaks about his wife and child calls himself a fool for spending NUM years on whaling and claims he can see his own child in starbucks eye 
starbuck tries to persuade ahab to return to nantucket to meet both their families but ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near fedallah 
on the first day of the chase ahab smells the whale climbs the mast and sights moby dick 
he claims the doubloon for himself and orders all boats to lower except for starbucks 
the whale bites ahabs boat in two tosses the captain out of it and scatters the crew 
on the second day of the chase ahab leaves starbuck in charge of the pequod
moby dick smashes the three boats that seek him into splinters and tangles their lines 
ahab is rescued but his ivory leg and fedallah are lost 
starbuck begs ahab to desist but ahab vows to slay the white whale even if he would have to dive through the globe itself to get his revenge 
on the third day of the chase ahab sights moby dick at noon and sharks appear as well 
ahab lowers his boat for a final time leaving starbuck again on board 
moby dick breaches and destroys two boats 
fedallahs corpse still entangled in the fouled lines is lashed to the whales back so moby dick turns out to be the hearse fedallah prophesied 
possessed by all the fallen angels ahab plants his harpoon in the whales flank 
moby dick smites the whaleboat tossing its men into the sea 
only ishmael is unable to return to the boat 
he is left behind in the sea and so is the only crewman of the pequod to survive the final encounter 
the whale now fatally attacks the pequod
ahab then realizes that the destroyed ship is the hearse made of american wood in fedallahs prophesy 
the whale returns to ahab who stabs at him again 
the line loops around ahabs neck and as the stricken whale swims away the captain is drawn with him out of sight 
queequegs coffin comes to the surface the only thing to escape the vortex when pequod sank 
for an entire day ishmael floats on it and then the rachel still looking for its lost seamen rescues him 
ishmael is the narrator shaping his story with use of many different genres including sermons stage plays soliloquies and emblematical readings 
repeatedly ishmael refers to his writing of the book but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chapters might be naught 
scholar john bryant calls him the novels central consciousness and narrative voice 
bezanson first distinguishes ishmael as narrator from ishmael as character whom he calls forecastle ishmael and who is the younger ishmael of some years ago 
narrator ishmael then is merely young ishmael grown older 
a second distinction avoids confusion of either of both ishmaels with the author herman melville 
bezanson warns readers to resist any one-to-one equation of melville and ishmael 
according to critic walter bezanson the chapter structure can be divided into chapter sequences chapter clusters and balancing chapters
the simplest sequences are of narrative progression then sequences of theme such as the three chapters on whale painting and sequences of structural similarity such as the five dramatic chapters beginning with the quarter-deck or the four chapters beginning with the candles
chapter clusters are the chapters on the significance of the colour white and those on the meaning of fire 
balancing chapters are chapters of opposites such as loomings versus the epilogue or similars such as the quarter-deck and the candles
scholar lawrence buell describes the arrangement of the non-narrative chapters as structured around three patterns first the nine meetings of the pequod with ships that have encountered moby dick 
each has been more and more severely damaged foreshadowing the pequods own fate 
second the increasingly impressive encounters with whales 
in the early encounters the whaleboats hardly make contact later there are false alarms and routine chases finally the massive assembling of whales at the edges of the china sea in the grand armada
a typhoon near japan sets the stage for ahabs confrontation with moby dick 
the third pattern is the cetological documentation so lavish that it can be divided into two subpatterns 
these chapters start with the ancient history of whaling and a bibliographical classification of whales getting closer with second-hand stories of the evil of whales in general and of moby dick in particular a chronologically ordered commentary on pictures of whales 
the climax to this section is chapter NUM of whales in paint etc 
 which begins with the humble a beggar in london and ends with the sublime the constellation cetus
the next chapter brit thus the other half of this pattern begins with the books first description of live whales and next the anatomy of the sperm whale is studied more or less from front to rear and from outer to inner parts all the way down to the skeleton 
two concluding chapters set forth the whales evolution as a species and claim its eternal nature 
some ten or more of the chapters on whale killings beginning at two-fifths of the book are developed enough to be called events
as bezanson writes in each case a killing provokes either a chapter sequence or a chapter cluster of cetological lore growing out of the circumstance of the particular killing thus these killings are structural occasions for ordering the whaling essays and sermons
buell observes that the narrative architecture is an idiosyncratic variant of the bipolar observerhero narrative that is the novel is structured around the two main characters ahab and ishmael who are intertwined and contrasted with each other with ishmael the observer and narrator 
as the story of ishmael remarks robert milder it is a narrative of education
bryant and springer find that the book is structured around the two consciousnesses of ahab and ishmael with ahab as a force of linearity and ishmael a force of digression 
while both have an angry sense of being orphaned they try to come to terms with this hole in their beings in different ways ahab with violence ishmael with meditation 
and while the plot in moby-dick may be driven by ahabs anger ishmaels desire to get a hold of the ungraspable accounts for the novels lyricism 
buell sees a double quest in the book ahabs is to hunt moby dick ishmaels is to understand what to make of both whale and hunt
one of the most distinctive features of the book is the variety of genres 
bezanson mentions sermons dreams travel account autobiography elizabethan plays and epic poetry 
he calls ishmaels explanatory footnotes to establish the documentary genre a nabokovian touch
a significant structural device is the series of nine meetings gams between the pequod and other ships 
these meetings are important in three ways 
first their placement in the narrative 
the initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other 
the central group of five gams are separated by about NUM chapters more or less 
this pattern provides a structural element remarks bezanson as if the encounters were bones to the books flesh
second ahabs developing responses to the meetings plot the rising curve of his passion and of his monomania 
third in contrast to ahab ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads 
bezanson sees no single way to account for the meaning of all of these ships 
instead they may be interpreted as a group of metaphysical parables a series of biblical analogues a masque of the situation confronting man a pageant of the humors within men a parade of the nations and so forth as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the white whale
scholar nathalia wright sees the meetings and the significance of the vessels along other lines 
she singles out the four vessels which have already encountered moby dick 
the first the jeroboam is named after the predecessor of the biblical king ahab 
her prophetic fate is a message of warning to all who follow articulated by gabriel and vindicated by the samuel enderby the rachel the delight and at last the pequod
none of the other ships has been completely destroyed because none of their captains shared ahabs monomania the fate of the jeroboam reinforces the structural parallel between ahab and his biblical namesake ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him i kings NUM
an early enthusiast for the melville revival british author em forster remarked in NUM moby-dick is full of meanings its meaning is a different problem 
yet he saw as the essential in the book its prophetic song which flows like an undercurrent beneath the surface action and morality 
biographer laurie robertson-lorant sees epistemology as the books theme 
ishmaels taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty
she also contrasts ishmael and ahabs attitudes toward life with ishmaels open-minded and meditative polypositional stance as antithetical to ahabs monomania adhering to dogmatic rigidity 
melville biographer delbanco cites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences 
all races are represented among the crew members of the pequod
although ishmael initially is afraid of queequeg as a tattooed cannibal he soon decides better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian 
while it may be rare for a mid-NUMth century american book to feature black characters in a nonslavery context slavery is frequently mentioned 
the theme of race is primarily carried by pip the diminutive black cabin boy 
when pip has almost drowned ahab genuinely touched by pips suffering questions him gently pip can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave pip
reward for pip
editors bryant and springer suggest perception is a central theme the difficulty of seeing and understanding which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down 
ahab explains that like all things the evil whale wears a disguise all visible objects man are but pasteboard masks  and ahab is determined to strike through the mask
how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall
to me the white whale is that wall ch 
NUM the quarter-deck
this theme pervades the novel perhaps never so emphatically as in the doubloon ch 
NUM where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality 
later the american edition has ahab discover no sign ch 
NUM of the whale when he is staring into the deep 
in fact moby dick is then swimming up at him 
in the british edition melville changed the word discover to perceive and with good reason for discovery means finding what is already there but perceiving or better still perception is a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it
the point is not that ahab would discover the whale as an object but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making 
yet melville does not offer easy solutions 
ishmael and queequegs sensual friendship initiates a kind of racial harmony that is shattered when the crews dancing erupts into racial conflict in midnight forecastle ch 
NUM
fifty chapters later pip suffers mental disintegration after he is reminded that as a slave he would be worth less money than a whale 
commodified and brutalized pip becomes the ships conscience
his views of property are another example of wrestling with moral choice 
in chapter NUM ishmael expounds the concept of the fast-fish and the loose-fish which gives right of ownership to those who take possession of an abandoned fish or ship and observes that the british empire took possession of american indian lands in colonial times in just the way that whalers take possession of an unclaimed whale 
the novel has also been read as being critical of the contemporary literary and philosophical movement transcendentalism attacking the thought of leading transcendentalist ralph waldo emerson in particular 
the life and death of ahab has been read as an attack on emersons philosophy of self reliance for one in its destructive potential and potential justification for egoism 
richard chase writes that for melville deathspiritual emotional physicalis the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point of solipsism where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self 
in that regard chase sees melvilles art as antithetical to that of emersons thought in that melville points up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard rather than as ... emerson loved to do suggested the vital possibilities of the self 
newton arvin further suggests that self-reliance was for melville really the masquerade in kingly weeds of a wild egoism anarchic irresponsible and destructive 
an incomplete inventory of the language of moby-dick by editors bryant and springer includes nautical biblical homeric shakespearean miltonic cetological influences and his style is alliterative fanciful colloquial archaic and unceasingly allusive melville tests and exhausts the possibilities of grammar quotes from a range of well-known or obscure sources and swings from calm prose to high rhetoric technical exposition seamans slang mystic speculation or wild prophetic archaism 
many words that make up the vocabulary of moby-dick are melvilles own coinages critic newton arvin recognizes as if the english vocabulary were too limited for the complex things melville had to express 
perhaps the most striking example is the use of verbal nouns mostly plural such as allurings coincidings and leewardings
equally abundant are unfamiliar adjectives and adverbs including participial adjectives such as officered omnitooled and uncatastrophied participial adverbs such as intermixingly postponedly and uninterpenetratingly rarities such as the adjectives unsmoothable spermy and leviathanic and adverbs such as sultanically spanishly and venetianly and adjectival compounds ranging from odd to magnificent such as the message-carrying air the circus-running sun and teeth-tiered sharks
it is rarer for melville to create his own verbs from nouns but he does this with what arvin calls irresistible effect such as in who didst thunder him higher than a throne and my fingers ..began ..to serpentine and spiralize
for arvin the essence of the writing style of moby-dick lies in

arvins categories have been slightly expanded by later critics most notably warner berthoff 
the superabundant vocabulary of the work can be broken down into strategies used individually and in combination 
first the original modification of words as leviathanism and the exaggerated repetition of modified words as in the series pitiable pity pitied and piteous ch 
NUM the pequod meets the virgin
second the use of existing words in new ways as when the whale heaps and tasks
third words lifted from specialized fields as fossiliferous
fourth the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations as in concentrating brow and immaculate manliness ch 
NUM knights and squires
fifth using the participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader as the words preluding and foreshadowing so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene in this foreshadowing interval
characteristic stylistic elements of another kind are the echoes and overtones 
responsible for this are both melvilles imitation of certain distinct styles and his habitual use of sources to shape his own work 
his three most important sources in order are the bible shakespeare and milton 
another notable stylistic element are the several levels of rhetoric the simplest of which is a relatively straightfoward expository style that is evident of many passages in the cetological chapters though they are rarely sustained and serve chiefly as transitions between more sophisticated levels 
one of these is the poetic level of rhetoric which bezanson sees well exemplified in ahabs quarter-deck soliloquy to the point that it can be set as blank verse 
set over a metrical patern the rhythms are evenly controlledtoo evenly perhaps for prose bezanson suggests 
a third level of rhetoric is the idiomatic and just as the poetic it hardly is present in pure form 
examples of this are the consistently excellent idiom of stubb such as in the way he encourages the rowing crew in a rhythm of speech that suggests the beat of the oars takes the place of the metronomic meter
the fourth and final level of rhetoric is the composite a magnificent blending of the first three and possible other elements

the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation 
there is his home there lies his buisiness which a noahs flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china 
he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps 
for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman 
with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales 
nantucket ch 
NUM
this passage from a chapter that bezanson calls a comical prose poem blends high and low with a relaxed assurance
similar great passages include the marvelous hymn to spiritual democracy that can be found in the middle of knights and squires
the elaborate use of the homeric simile may not have been learned from homer himself yet matthiessen finds the writing more consistently alive on the homeric than on the shakespearean level especially during the final chase the controlled accumulation of such similes emphasizes ahabs hubris through a succession of land-images for instance the ship tore on leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball missent becomes a ploughshare and turns up the level field the chase  second day ch 
NUM
one paragraph-long simile describes how the NUM men of the crew became a single unit

for as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hempyet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of the crew this mans valor that mans fear guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to 
the chase  second day ch 
NUM
the final phrase fuses the two halves of the comparison the men become identical with the ship which follows ahabs direction 
the concentration only gives way to more imagery with the mastheads like the tops of tall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs
all these images contribute their startling energy to the advance of the narrative 
when the boats are lowered the imagery serves to dwarf everything but ahabs will in the presence of moby dick 
these similes with their astonishing imaginative abundance are not only invaluable in creating the dramatic movement matthiessen observes they are no less notable for breadth and the more sustained among them for an heroic dignity 
the influence of shakespeare on the book has been analyzed by fo 
matthiessen in his NUM study of the american renaissance with such results that almost a half century later bezanson still considered him the richest critic on these matters 
according to matthiesen then melvilles possession by shakespeare went far beyond all other influences in that it made melville discover his own full strength through the challenge of the most abundant imagination in history
especially the influence of king lear and macbeth has attracted scholarly attention 
on almost every page debts to shakespeare can be discovered whether hard or easy to recognize 
matthiessen points out that the mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing at the end of cetology ch NUM echo the famous phrase in macbeth told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing 
as matthiessen demonstrates ahabs first extended speech to the crew in the quarter-deck ch NUM is virtually blank verse and can be printed as such

but look ye starbuck what is said in heat
that thing unsays itself 
there are men
from whom warm words are small indignity 
i mean not to incense thee 
let it go 
look
see yonder turkish cheeks of spotted tawn--
living breathing pictures painted by the sun 
the pagan leopardsthe unrecking and
unworshipping things that live and seek and give
no reason for the torrid life they feel
most importantly through shakespeare melville infused moby-dick with a power of expression he had not previously possessed 
reading shakespeare matthiessen observes had been a catalytic agent for melville one that transformed his writing from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces
the extent to which melville was in full possession of his powers is demonstrated by matthiessen through the description of ahab which ends in language that suggests shakespeares but is not an imitation of it oh ahab
what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air
the imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly shakespearean but its two key words appear only once each in the plays .. and to neither of these usages is melville indebted for his fresh combination 
melvilles assimilation of shakespeare matthiessen concludes gave moby-dick a kind of diction that depended upon no source and that could as dh lawrence put it convey something almost superhuman or inhuman bigger than life
the prose is not based on anybody elses verse but on a sense of speech rhythm
in addition to this sense of rhythm melville acquired verbal resources which for matthiessen showed that he now mastered shakespeares mature secret of how to make language itself dramatic
he had learned three essential things matthiessen sums up

the creation of ahab melville biographer leon howard discovered followed an observation by coleridge in his lecture on hamlet one of shakespeares modes of creating characters is to conceive any one intellectual or moral faculty in morbid excess and then to place himself ..thus mutilated or diseased under given circumstances
coleridges vocabulary is echoed in some phrases that describe ahab 
ahab seemed to have what seems a half-wilful over-ruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature and all men tragically great melville added are made so through a certain morbidness all mortal greatness is but disease
in addition to this in howards view the self-references of ishmael as a tragic dramatist and his defense of his choice of a hero who lacked all outward majestical trappings is evidence that melville consciously thought of his protagonist as a tragic hero of the sort found in hamlet and king lear
moby-dick is based on melvilles experience on the whaler acushnet however even the books most factual accounts of whaling are not straight autobiography 
on december NUM NUM he signed on as a green hand for the maiden voyage of the acushnet planned to last for NUM months 
its owner melvin o bradford resembled bildad who signed on ishmael in that he was a quaker on several instances when he signed documents he erased the word swear and replaced it with affirm
but the shareholders of the acushnet were relatively wealthy whereas the owners of the pequod included poor widows and orphaned children 
its captain was valentine pease jr  who was NUM years old at the start of the voyage 
although NUM men signed up as crew members two did not show up for the ships departure and were replaced by one new crew member 
the crew was not as heterogenous or exotic as the crew of the pequod
five of the crew were foreigners four of them portuguese and the others were american either at birth or naturalized 
three black men were in the crew two seamen and the cook 
fleece the cook of the pequod was also black so probably modeled on this philadelphia-born william maiden who was NUM years old when he signed for the acushnet
only NUM of the NUM original crew members completed the voyage 
the others either deserted or were regularly discharged 
the first officer frederic raymond left the ship after a fight with the captain 
a first mate actually called edward c starbuck was on an earlier voyage with captain pease in the early NUMs and was discharged at tahiti under mysterious circumstances 
the second mate on the acushnet was john hall english-born but a naturalized american 
he is identified as stubb in an annotation in the books copy of crew member henry hubbard who like melville had joined the voyage as a green hand 
hubbard also identified the model for pip john backus a little black man added to the crew during the voyage 
hubbards annotation appears in the chapter the castaway and reveals that pips falling into the water was authentic hubbard was with him in the same boat when the incident occurred 
ahab seems to have had no model in real life though his death may have been based on an actual event 
on may NUM NUM melville was aboard the star which sailed for honolulu 
aboard were two sailors from the nantucket who could have told him that they had seen their second mate taken out of a whaleboat by a foul line and drowned
the model for the whalemans chapel of chapter NUM is the seamens bethel on johnny cake hill 
melville attended a service there shortly before he shipped out on the acushnet and he heard a sermon by the chaplain NUM-year-old reverend enoch mudge who is at least in part the model for father mapple 
even the topic of jonah and the whale may be authentic for mudge was a contributor to sailors magazine which printed in december NUM the ninth of a series of sermons on jonah 
in addition to his own experience on the whaling ship acushnet two actual events served as the genesis for melvilles tale 
one was the sinking of the nantucket ship essex in NUM after a sperm whale rammed her NUM miles NUMkm from the western coast of south america 
first mate owen chase one of eight survivors recorded the events in his NUM narrative of the most extraordinary and distressing shipwreck of the whale-ship essex
the other event was the alleged killing in the late NUMs of the albino sperm whale mocha dick in the waters off the chilean island of mocha 
mocha dick was rumored to have NUM or so harpoons in his back from other whalers and appeared to attack ships with premeditated ferocity 
one of his battles with a whaler served as subject for an article by explorer jeremiah n reynolds in the may NUM issue of the knickerbocker or new-york monthly magazine
melville was familiar with the article which described significantly reynolds writes a first-person narration that serves as a frame for the story of a whaling captain he meets 
the captain resembles ahab and suggests a similar symbolism and single-minded motivation in hunting this whale in that when his crew first encounters mocha dick and cowers from him the captain rallies them 

mocha dick had over NUM encounters with whalers in the decades between NUM and the NUMs 
he was described as being gigantic and covered in barnacles 
although he was the most famous mocha dick was not the only white whale in the sea nor the only whale to attack hunters 
while an accidental collision with a sperm whale at night accounted for sinking of the union in NUM it was not until august NUM that the whaler ann alexander while hunting in the pacific off the galpagos islands became the second vessel since the essex to be attacked holed and sunk by a whale 
melville remarked ye gods
what a commentator is this ann alexander whale 
what he has to say is short  pithy  very much to the point 
i wonder if my evil art has raised this monster 
while melville had already drawn on his different sailing experiences in his previous novels such as mardi he had never focused specifically on whaling 
the NUM months he spent as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler acushnet in NUM and one incident in particular now served as inspiration 
during a mid-ocean gam rendezvous at sea between ships he met chases son william who lent him his fathers book 
melville later wrote 

the book was out of print and rare 
melville let his interest in the book be known to his father-in-law lemuel shaw whose friend in nantucket procured an imperfect but clean copy which shaw gave to melville in april NUM
melville read this copy avidly made copious notes in it and had it bound keeping it in his library for the rest of his life 
moby-dick contains large sectionsmost of them narrated by ishmaelthat seemingly have nothing to do with the plot but describe aspects of the whaling business 
although a successful earlier novel about nantucket whalers had been written miriam coffin or the whale-fisherman NUM by joseph c hart which is credited with influencing elements of melvilles work most accounts of whaling tended to be sensational tales of bloody mutiny and melville believed that no book up to that time had portrayed the whaling industry in as fascinating or immediate a way as he had experienced it 
melville found the bulk of his data on whales and whaling in five books the most important of which was by the english ships surgeon thomas beale natural history of the sperm whale NUM a book of reputed authority which melville bought on july NUM NUM
in scale and complexity scholar steven olsen-smith writes the significance of this source to the composition of moby-dick surpasses that of any other source book from which melville is known to have drawn 
according to scholar howard p vincent the general influence of this source is to supply the arrangement of whaling data in chapter groupings 
melville followed beales grouping closely yet adapted it to what art demanded and he changed the originals prosaic phrases into graphic figures of speech 
the second most important whaling book is frederick debell bennett a whaling voyage round the globe from the year NUM to NUM NUM from which melville also took the chapter organization but in a lesser degree than he learned from beale 
the third book was the one melville reviewed for the literary world in NUM j ross brownes etchings of a whaling cruise NUM which may have given melville the first thought for a whaling book and in any case contains passages embarrassingly similar to passages in moby-dick
the fourth book reverend henry t cheevers the whale and his captors NUM was used for two episodes in moby-dick but probably appeared too late in the writing of the novel to be of much more use 
melville did plunder a fifth book william scoresby jr  an account of the arctic regions with a history and description of the northern whale fishery NUM thoughunlike the other four booksits subject is the greenland whale rather than the sperm whale 
although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication melville satirized and parodied it on several occasionsfor instance in the description of narwhales in the chapter cetology where he called scoresby charley coffin and gave his account a humorous twist of fact scoresby will help out melville several times and on each occasion melville will satirize him under a pseudonym 
vincent suggests several reasons for melvilles attitude towards scoresby including his dryness and abundance of irrelevant data but the major reason seems to have been that the greenland whale was the sperm whales closest competitor for the publics attention so melville felt obliged to dismiss anything dealing with it 
the earliest surviving mention of the composition of what became moby-dick is the final paragraph of the letter melville wrote to richard henry dana jr on may NUM NUM

some scholars have concluded that melville composed moby-dick in two or even three stages 
reasoning from a series of inconsistencies and structural developments in the final version they hypothesize that the work he mentioned to dana was in the words of lawrence buell a relatively straightforward whaling adventure but that reading shakespeare and his encounters with hawthorne inspired him to rewrite it as an epic of cosmic encyclopedic proportions
bezanson objects that the letter contains too many ambiguities to assume that danas suggestion would obviously be that melville do for whaling what he had done for life on a man-of-war in white-jacket
in addition dana had experienced how incomparable melville was in dramatic story telling when he met him in boston so perhaps his suggestion was that melville do a book that captured that gift
and the long sentence in the middle of the above quotation simply acknowledges that melville is struggling with the problem not of choosing between fact and fancy but of how to interrelate them 
the most positive statements are that it will be a strange sort of a book and that melville means to give the truth of the thing but what thing exactly is not clear 
melville may have found the plot before writing or developed it after the writing process was underway 
considering his elaborate use of sources it is safe to say that they helped him shape the narrative its plot included 
scholars john bryant and haskell springer cite the development of the character ishmael as another factor which prolonged melvilles process of composition and which can be deduced from the structure of the final version of the book 
ishmael in the early chapters is simply the narrator just as the narrators in melvilles earlier sea adventures had been but in later chapters becomes a mystical stage manager who is central to the tragedy 
less than two months after mentioning the project to dana melville reported in a letter of june NUM to richard bentley his english publisher

nathaniel hawthorne and his family had moved to a small red farmhouse near lenox massachusetts at the end of march NUM
he became friends with oliver wendell holmes sr and melville beginning on august NUM NUM when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend 
melville wrote an unsigned review of hawthornes short story collection mosses from an old manse titled hawthorne and his mosses which appeared in the literary world on august NUM and NUM
bezanson finds the essay so deeply related to melvilles imaginative and intellectual world while writing moby-dick that it could be regarded as a virtual preface and should be everybodys prime piece of contextual reading
in the essay melville compares hawthorne to shakespeare and dante and his self-projection is evident in the repeats of the word genius the more than two dozen references to shakespeare and in the insistence that shakespeares unapproachability is nonsense for an american 
the most intense work on the book was done during the winter of NUM when melville had changed the noise of new york city for a farm in pittsfield massachusetts 
the move may well have delayed finishing the book 
during these months he wrote several excited letters to hawthorne including one of june NUM in which he summarizes his career what i feel most moved to write that is banned  it will not pay 
yet altogether write the other way i cannot 
so the product is a final hash and all my books are botches 
this is the stubborn melville who stood by mardi and talked about his other more commercial books with contempt 
the letter also reveals how melville experienced his development from his NUMth year three weeks have scarcely passed at any time between then and now that i have not unfolded within myself 
but i feel that i am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould 
one other theory holds that getting to know hawthorne first inspired him to write ahabs tragic obsession into the book but bryant and springer object that melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination such as the bibles jonah and job miltons satan shakespeares king lear byrons heroes 
theories of the composition of the book have been harpooned in three ways first by raising objections against the use of evidence and the evidence itself 
scholar robert milder sees insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology at work 
john bryant finds little concrete evidence and nothing at all conclusive to show that melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book
a second type of objection is based upon melvilles intellectual development 
bezanson is not convinced that before he met hawthorne melville was not ready for the kind of book moby-dick became because in his letters from the time melville denounces his last two straight narratives redburn and white-jacket as two books written just for the money and he firmly stood by mardi as the kind of book he believed in 
his language is already richly steeped in NUMth-century mannerisms characteristics of moby-dick
a third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence 
according to milder the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters can bear intimate thematic relation to a symbolic story not yet conceived
buell finds that theories based on a combination of selected passages from letters and what are perceived as loose ends in the book not only tend to dissolve into guesswork but he also suggests that these so-called loose ends may be intended by the author repeatedly the book mentions the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors
despite all this buell finds the evidence that melville changed his ambitions during writing on the whole convincing
melville first proposed the english publication in a NUM june NUM letter to richard bentley london publisher of his earlier works 
textual scholar g thomas tanselle explains that for these earlier books american proof sheets had been sent to the english publisher and that publication in the united states had been held off until the work had been set in type and published in england 
this procedure was intended to provide the best though still uncertain claim for the english copyright of an american work 
in the case of moby-dick melville had taken almost a year longer than promised and could not rely on harpers to prepare the proofs as they had done for the earlier books 
indeed harpers had denied him an advance and since he was already in debt to them for almost NUM he was forced to borrow money and to arrange for the typesetting and plating himself 
john bryant suggests that he did so to reduce the number of hands playing with his text
the final stages of composition overlapped with the early stages of publication 
in june NUM melville wrote to hawthorne that he was in new york to work and slave on my whale while it is driving through the press
by the end of the month wearied with the long delay of printers melville came back to finish work on the book in pittsfield 
three weeks later the typesetting was almost done as he announced to bentley on NUM july i am now passing thro the press the closing sheets of my new work
while melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set the corrected proof would be plated that is the type fixed in final form 
since earlier chapters were already plated when he was revising the later ones melville must have felt restricted in the kinds of revisions that were feasible
on NUM july NUM bentley offered melville NUM and half profits that is half the profits that remained after the expenses of production and advertising 
on NUM july melville accepted after which bentley drew up a contract on NUM august 
melville signed and returned the contract in early september and then went to new york with the proof sheets made from the finished plates which he sent to london by his brother allan on NUM september 
for over a month these proofs had been in melvilles possession and because the book would be set anew in england he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them 
he still had no american publisher so the usual hurry about getting the english publication to precede the american was not present 
only on NUM september was the harper publishing contract signed 
bentley received the proof sheets with melvilles corrections and revisions marked on them on september NUM
he published the book less than four weeks later 
in the october NUM issue of harpers new monthly magazine the town hos story was published with a footnote reading from the whale
the title of a new work by mr melville in the press of harper and brothers and now publishing in london by mr 
bentley 
on NUM october the english edition the whale was published in a printing of only NUM copies fewer than melvilles previous books 
their slow sales had convinced bentley that a smaller number was more realistic 
the london morning herald on october NUM printed the earliest known review 
on NUM november the american edition moby-dick was published and the same day reviewed in both the albany argus and the morning courier and new-york enquirer
on NUM november washington received the copy to be deposited for copyright purposes 
the first american printing of NUM copies was almost the same as the first of mardi but the first printing of melvilles other three harper books had been a thousand copies more 
the english edition set by bentleys printers from the american page proofs with melvilles revisions and corrections differs from the american edition in over NUM wordings and thousands of punctuation and spelling changes 
excluding the preliminaries and the one extract the three volumes of the english edition came to NUM pages and the single american volume to NUM pages 
accordingly the dedication to hawthorne in the american edition  this book is inscribed to became these volumes are inscribed to in the english 
the table of contents in the english edition generally follows the actual chapter titles in the american edition but NUM titles in the american table of contents differ from the titles above the chapters themselves 
this list was probably drawn up by melville himself the titles of chapters describing encounters of the pequod with other ships hadapparently to stress the parallelisms between these chaptersbeen standardized to the pequod meets the .. with the exception of the already published the town-hos story
for unknown reasons the etymology and extracts were moved to the end of the third volume 
an epigraph from paradise lost taken from the second of the two quotations from that work in the american edition appears on the title page of each of the three english volumes 
melvilles involvement with this rearrangement is not clear if it was bentleys gesture toward accommodating melville as tanselle suggests its selection put an emphasis on the quotation melville may not have agreed with 
the largest of melvilles revisions is the addition to the english edition of a NUM-word footnote in chapter NUM explaining the word gally
the edition also contains six short phrases and some NUM single words lacking in the american edition 
in addition about NUM changes produce genuine improvements as opposed to mere corrections melville may not have made every one of the changes in this category but it seems certain that he was responsible for the great majority of them 
the british publisher hired one or more revisers who were in the evaluation of scholar steven olsen-smith responsible for unauthorized changes ranging from typographical errors and omissions to acts of outright censorship
according to biographer robertson-lorant the result was that the english edition was badly mutilated
the expurgations fall into four categories ranked according to the apparent priorities of the censor
these expurgations also meant that any corrections or revisions melville may have marked upon these passages are now lost 
the final difference in the material not already plated is that the epilogue thus ishmaels miraculous survival is omitted from the british edition 
obviously the epilogue was not an afterthought supplied too late for the english edition for it is referred to in the castaway in the sequel of the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself 
why the epilogue is missing is unknown 
since nothing objectionable was in it most likely it was somehow lost by bentleys printer when the etymology and extracts were moved 
after the sheets had been sent melville changed the title 
probably late in september allan sent bentley two pages of proof with a letter of which only a draft survives which informed him that melville has determined upon a new title  dedicationenclosed you have proof of bothit is thought here that the new title will be a better selling title
after expressing his hope that bentley would receive this change in time allan said that moby-dick is a legitimate title for the book being the name given to a particular whale who if i may so express myself is the hero of the volume
biographer hershel parker suggests that the reason for the change was that harpers had two years earlier published a book with a similar title the whale and his captors
changing the title was not a problem for the american edition since the running heads throughout the book only showed the titles of the chapters and the title page which would include the publishers name could not be printed until a publisher was found 
in october harpers new monthly magazine printed chapter NUM the town-hos story with a footnote saying from the whale 
the title of a new work by mr melville
the one surviving leaf of proof a trial page bearing the title the whale and the harper imprint shows that at this point after the publisher had been found the original title still stood 
when allans letter arrived no sooner than early october bentley had already announced the whale in both the athenaem and the spectator of NUM and NUM october 
probably to accommodate melville bentley inserted a half-title page in the first volume only which reads the whale or moby dick
the british printing of NUM copies sold fewer than NUM within the first four months 
in NUM some remaining sheets were bound in a cheaper casing and in NUM enough sheets were still left to issue a cheap edition in one volume 
bentley recovered only half on the NUM he advanced melville whose share from actual sales would have been just NUM and he did not print a new edition 
harpers first printing was NUM copies including the standard NUM review copies 
the selling price was NUM.NUM about a fifth of the price of the british three-volume edition 
about NUM copies were sold within NUM days and then sales slowed down to less than NUM the next year 
after three years the first edition was still available almost NUM copies of which were lost when a fire broke out at the firm in december NUM
in NUM a second printing of NUM copies was issued in NUM a third of NUM copies and finally in NUM a fourth printing of NUM copies which sold so slowly that no new printing was ordered 
moby-dick was out of print during the last four years of melvilles life having sold NUM in its first year and a half and on average NUM copies a year for the next NUM years totaling NUM copies 
melvilles earnings from the book add up to NUM the NUM advance from bentley was equivalent to NUM and the american printings earned him NUM which was NUM less than he earned from any of his five previous books 
melvilles widow received another NUM when the united states book company issued the book and sold almost NUM copies between NUM and NUM
the reception of the whale in britain and of moby-dick in the united states differed in two ways according to parker 
first british literary criticism was more sophisticated and developed than in the still young republic with british reviewing done by cadres of brilliant literary people who were experienced critics and trenchant prose stylists while the united states had only a handful of reviewers capable enough to be called critics and american editors and reviewers habitually echoed british opinion 
american reviewing was mostly delegated to newspaper staffers or else by amateur contributors more noted for religious piety than critical acumen 
second the differences between the two editions caused two distinct critical receptions 
twenty-one reviews appeared in london and later one in dublin 
the british reviewers according to parker mostly regarded the whale as a phenomenal literary work a philosophical metaphysical and poetic romance
the morning advertiser for october NUM was in awe of melvilles learning of his dramatic ability for producing a prose poem and of the whale adventures which were powerful in their cumulated horrors 
to its surprise john bull found philosophy in whales and poetry in blubber and concluded that few books that claimed to be either philosophical or literary works contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as the tale of the pequods whaling expedition making it a work far beyond the level of an ordinary work of fiction
the morning post found it one of the cleverest wittiest and most amusing of modern books and predicted that it was a book which will do great things for the literary reputation of its author
melville himself never saw these reviews and parker calls it a bitter irony that the reception overseas was all he could possibly have hoped for short of a few conspicuous proclamations that the distance between him and shakespeare was by no means immeasurable 
one of the earliest reviews by the extremely conservative critic henry chorley in the highly regarded london athenaeum described it as 

according to the london literary gazette and journal of science and art for december NUM NUM mr melville cannot do without savages so he makes half of his dramatis personae wild indians malays and other untamed humanities who appeared in an odd book professing to be a novel wantonly eccentric outrageously bombastic in places charmingly and vividly descriptive
most critics regretted the extravagant digressions because they distracted from an otherwise interesting and even exciting narrative but even critics who did not like the book as a whole recognized the genius evident in melvilles originality of imagination and expression 
one problem was that since the english edition omitted the epilogue british reviewers read a book with a first-person narrator who apparently did not survive to tell the tale 
the reviewer of the literary gazette asked how ishmael who appears to have been drowned with the rest communicated his notes to mr bentley
the reviewer in the spectator objected that nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known thus he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if they all perish 
the dublin university magazine asked how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story
and the literary gazette declared that how the writer who appears to have been drowned with the rest communicated his notes for publication to mr bentley is not explained
a few other reviewers who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of ishmael telling the story pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages 
other reviewers were fascinated enough with the book to accept its perceived flaws 
john bull praised the author for making literature out of unlikely and even unattractive matter and the morning post found that delight far oustripped the improbable character of events 
though some reviewers viewed the characters especially ahab as exaggerated many understood it took an extraordinary character to undertake the battle with the white whale 
melvilles style was usually praised regardless of the reviewers judgment of the book but some perceived the same tendency to over-doing here and some found his style too american 
some sixty reviews appeared in america the criterion for counting as a review being more than two lines of comment 
only a couple of reviewers expressed themselves early enough not to be influenced by news of the british reception 
though moby-dick did contain the epilogue and so accounted for ishmaels survival the british reviews influenced the american reception 
the earliest american review in the boston post for november NUM quoted the london athenaeums scornful review not realizing that some of the criticism of the whale did not pertain to moby-dick
this last point and the authority and influence of british criticism in american reviewing is clear from the reviews opening we have read nearly one half of this book and are satisfied that the london athenaeum is right in calling it an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact
though the post quoted the greater portion of the review it omitted the condensed extract of melvilles prose the athenaeum had included to give readers an example of it 
the post deemed the price of one dollar and fifty cents far too much the whale is not worth the money asked for it either as a literary work or as a mass of printed paper
the new york north american miscellany for december summarized the verdict in the athenaeum
the reviewer of the december new york eclectic magazine had actually read moby-dick in full and was puzzled why the athenaeum was so scornful of the ending 
the attack on the whale by the spectator was reprinted in the december new york international magazine which inaugurated the influence of another unfavorable review 
rounding off what american readers were told about the british reception in january harpers monthly magazine attempted some damage control and wrote that the book had excited a general interest among the london magazines 
the most influential american review ranked according to the number of references to it appeared in the weekly magazine literary world which had printed melvilles mosses essay the preceding year 
the author of the unsigned review in two installments on NUM and NUM november was later identified as publisher evert duyckinck 
the first half of the first installment was devoted to an event of remarkable coincidence early in the month between the publishing of the british and the american edition a whale had sunk the new bedford whaler ann alexander near chile 
in the second installment duyckinck described moby-dick as three books rolled into one he was pleased with the book as far as it was a thorough account of the sperm whale less so with it as far as the adventures of the pequod crew were considered perceiving the characters as unrealistic and expressing inappropriate opinions on religions and condemned the essayistic rhapsodizing and moralizing with what he thought was little respect of what must be to the world the most sacred associations of life violated and defaced 
the review prompted hawthorne to take the unusually aggressive step of reproving duyckinck by criticizing the review in a letter to duyckinck of december NUM

what a book melville has written
it gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones 
it hardly seemed to me that the review of it in the literary world did justice to its best points 
the transendental socialist george ripley published a review in the new york tribune for NUM november in which he compared the book favorable to mardi because the occasional touches of the subtle mysticism was not carried on to excess but kept within boundaries by the solid realism of the whaling context 
ripley was almost surely also the author of the review in harpers for december which saw in ahabs quest the slight framework for something else beneath the whole story the subtle imaginative reader may perhaps find a pregnant allegory intended to illustrate the mystery of human life 
among the handful of other favorable reviews was one in the albion on NUM november which saw the book as a blend of truth and satire 
melvilles friend nathaniel parker willis reviewing the book in the NUM november home journal found it a very racy spirited curious and entertaining book ..it enlists the curiosity excites the sympathies and often charms the fancy
in the NUM december spirit of the times editor william t porter praised the book and all of melvilles five earlier works as the writings of a man who is at once philosopher painter and poet
some other shorter reviews mixed their praise with genuine reservations about the irreverence and profane jesting as the new haven daily palladium for NUM november phrased it 
many reviewers parker observes had come to the conclusion that melville was capable of producing enjoyable romances but they could not see in him the author of great literature 
within a year after melvilles death moby-dick along with typee omoo and mardi was reprinted by harper  brothers giving it a chance to be rediscovered 
however only new yorks literary underground seemed to take much interest just enough to keep melvilles name circulating for the next NUM years in the capital of american publishing 
during this time a few critics were willing to devote time space and a modicum of praise to melville and his works or at least those that could still be fairly easily obtained or remembered 
other works especially the poetry went largely forgotten 
in NUM american author carl van doren became the first of this period to proselytize about melvilles value 
his NUM study the american novel called moby-dick a pinnacle of american romanticism 
in his NUM idiosyncratic but influential studies in classic american literature novelist poet and short story writer d h lawrence celebrated the originality and value of american authors among them melville 
perhaps surprisingly lawrence saw moby-dick as a work of the first order despite his using the expurgated original english edition which also lacked the epilogue 
the modern library brought out moby-dick in NUM and the lakeside press in chicago commissioned rockwell kent to design and illustrate a striking three-volume edition which appeared in NUM
random house then issued a one-volume trade version of kents edition which in NUM they reprinted as a less expensive modern library giant 
the novel has been adapted or represented in art film books cartoons television and more than a dozen versions in comic-book format 
the first adaptation was the NUM silent movie the sea beast starring john barrymore in which ahab kills the whale and returns to marry his fiance 
the most famous adaptation was the john huston NUM film produced from a screenplay by author ray bradbury 
the long list of adaptations as bryant and springer put it demonstrates that the iconic image of an angry embittered american slaying a mythic beast seemed to capture the popular imagination showing how different readers in different periods of popular culture have rewritten moby-dick to make it a true cultural icon
american author ralph ellison wrote a tribute to the book in the prologue of his NUM novel invisible man where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evocates a church service brothers and sisters my text this morning is the blackness of blackness 
and the congregation answers that blackness is most black brother most black .. this scene ellison biographer arnold rampersad observes reprises a moment in the second chapter of moby-dick where ishmael wanders around new bedford looking for a place to spend the night and momentarily joins a congregation it was a negro church and the preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there 
according to rampersad it was melville who empowered ellison to insist on a place in the american literary tradition by his example of representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text
rampersaf also believes ellisons choice of a first-person narrator was inspired above all by moby-dick and the novel even has a similar opening sentence with the narrator introducing himself i am an invisible man
the oration by ellisons blind preacher barbee resembles father mapples sermon in that both prepare the reader for what is to come 
american songwriter bob dylan elaborated on the book in his nobel prize acceptance speech of NUM citing the book as one of the three books that influenced him most 
dylans description of the book ends with an acknowledgment that theme and all that it implies would work its way into more than a few of my songs

mrs stephens had been a widow for several years prior to margarets birth captain john stephens died in NUM
after his death she inherited property on jackson street where margarets family lived 
grandmother annie stephens was quite a character both vulgar and a tyrant 
after gaining control of her father philip fitzgeralds money after he died she splurged on her younger daughters including margarets mother and sent them to finishing school in the north 
there they learned that irish americans were not treated as equal to other immigrants and that it was shameful to be a daughter of an irishman 
margarets relationship with her grandmother would become quarrelsome in later years as she entered adulthood 
however for margaret her grandmother was a great source of eye-witness information about the civil war and reconstruction in atlanta prior to her death in NUM
in an accident that was traumatic for her mother although she was unharmed when little margaret was about three years old her dress caught fire on an iron grate 
fearing it would happen again her mother began dressing her in boys pants and she was nicknamed jimmy the name of a character in the comic strip little jimmy
her brother insisted she would have to be a boy named jimmy to play with him 
having no sisters to play with margaret said she was a boy named jimmy until she was fourteen 
stephens mitchell said his sister was a tomboy who would happily play with dolls occasionally and she liked to ride her texas plains pony 
as a little girl margaret went riding every afternoon with a confederate veteran and a young lady of beau-age

when i was ten years old it was a violent shock to learn that general lee had been defeated

i still find it hard to believe so strong are childhood impressions

the mayhem of the atlanta race riot occurred over four days in september NUM when mitchell was five years old 
local newspapers alleged that several white women had been assaulted by black men prompting an angry mob of NUM to assemble in the streets 
eugene mitchell went to bed early the night the rioting began but was awakened by the sounds of gunshots 
the following morning he learned NUM negroes had been killed 
he wrote to his wife that rioters attempted to kill every negro in sight 
as the rioting continued rumors ran wild that negroes would burn jackson hill 
at margarets suggestion her father who did not own a gun stood guard with a sword 
though she and her family were unharmed twenty years later margaret was able to recall the terror she felt during the riot 
mitchell grew up in a southern culture where the threat of black on white rape incited mob violence and in this world white georgians lived in fear of the black beast rapist
soon after the riot margarets family decided to move away from jackson hill 
in NUM they moved to the east side of peachtree street just north of seventeenth street in atlanta 
past the nearest neighbors house was forest and beyond it the chattahoochee river 
mitchells former jackson hill home was destroyed in the great atlanta fire of NUM
while the south exists as a geographical region of the united states it is also said to exist as a place of the imagination of writers 
an image of the south was fixed in mitchells imagination when at six years old her mother took her on a buggy tour through ruined plantations and shermans sentinels the brick and stone chimneys that remained after william tecumseh shermans march and torch through georgia 
mitchell would later recall what her mother had said to her

she talked about the world those people had lived in such a secure world and how it had exploded beneath them 
and she told me that my world was going to explode under me someday and god help me if i didnt have some weapon to meet the new world 
from an imagination cultivated in her youth margaret mitchells defensive weapon would become her writing 
mitchell said she heard civil war stories from her relatives when she was growing up

dixons popular trilogy of novels the leopards spots a romance of the white mans burden NUM  NUM and the traitor a story of the rise and fall of the invisible empire NUM all depicted in vivid terms a white south victimized during the reconstruction by northern carpetbaggers and freed slaves with an especial emphasis upon reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok raping white women with impunity 
as a teenager mitchell liked dixons books so much that she organized the local children to put on dramatizations of his books 
the picture the white supremacist dixon drew of reconstruction is now rejected as inaccurate but at the time the memory of the past was such it was widely believed by white americans 
in a letter to dixon dated NUM august NUM mitchell wrote i was practically raised on your books and love them very much

NUM in which a good knight and a bad knight duel for the hand of the lady 
in the arrow brave and the deer maiden ca 
NUM a half-white indian brave jack must withstand the pain inflicted upon him to uphold his honor and win the girl

an average student at smith college mitchell did not excel in any area of academics 
she held a low estimation of her writing abilities 
even though her english professor had praised her work she felt the praise was undue 
after finishing her freshman year at smith mitchell returned to atlanta to take over the household for her father and never returned to college 
in october NUM while regaining her strength after an appendectomy she confided to a friend that giving up college and her dreams of a journalistic career to keep house and take her mothers place in society meant giving up all the worthwhile things that counted fornothing

in the gin and jazz style of the times she did her flapping in the NUMs 
at a NUM atlanta debutante charity ball she performed an apache dance

the apache and the tango were scandalous dances for their elements of eroticism the latter popularized in a NUM silent film the four horsemen of the apocalypse that made its lead actor rudolph valentino a sex symbol for his ability to tango 
mitchell was in her own words an unscrupulous flirt
she found herself engaged to five men but maintained that she neither lied to or misled any of them 
a local gossip columnist who wrote under the name polly peachtree described mitchells love life in a NUM column

...she has in her brief life perhaps had more men really truly dead in love with her more honest-to-goodness suitors than almost any other girl in atlanta

less thrilled by his looks than his chief charm his low husky voice with a soft sibilant accent she described his face as swarthy

his face was swarthy so brown that his white teeth flashed in startling contrast to his skin his eyestired bored but courteous 
mitchell was quite thrilled when valentino took her in his arms and carried her inside from the rooftop of the georgian terrace hotel 
many of her stories were vividly descriptive 
in an article titled bridesmaid of eighty-seven recalls mittie roosevelts wedding she wrote of a white-columned mansion in which lived the last surviving bridesmaid at theodore roosevelts mothers wedding

the tall white columns glimpsed through the dark green of cedar foliage the wide veranda encircling the house the stately silence engendered by the century-old oaks evoke memories of thomas nelson pages on virginia

he died in NUM and the novella remained undiscovered among some letters she had written to him until NUM

in lost laysen mitchell explores the dynamics of three male characters and their relationship to the only female character courtenay ross a strong-willed american missionary to the south pacific island of laysen 
the narrator of the tale is billy duncan a rough hardened soldier of fortune who is frequently involved in fights that leave him near death

hawthorne died on may NUM NUM and was survived by his wife and their three children 
much of hawthornes writing centers on new england many works featuring moral metaphors with an anti-puritan inspiration 
his fiction works are considered part of the romantic movement and more specifically dark romanticism

nathaniel hawthorne was born on july NUM NUM in salem massachusetts his birthplace is preserved and open to the public 
william hathorne was the authors great-great-great-grandfather 
he was a puritan and was the first of the family to emigrate from england settling in dorchester massachusetts before moving to salem 
there he became an important member of the massachusetts bay colony and held many political positions including magistrate and judge becoming infamous for his harsh sentencing 
williams son and the authors great-great-grandfather john hathorne was one of the judges who oversaw the salem witch trials 
hawthorne probably added the w to his surname in his early twenties shortly after graduating from college in an effort to dissociate himself from his notorious forebears 
hawthornes father nathaniel hathorne sr was a sea captain who died in NUM of yellow fever in suriname he had been a member of the east india marine society 
after his death his widow moved with young nathaniel and two daughters to live with relatives named the mannings in salem where they lived for NUM years 
young hawthorne was hit on the leg while playing bat and ball on november NUM NUM and he became lame and bedridden for a year though several physicians could find nothing wrong with him 
in the summer of NUM the family lived as boarders with farmers before moving to a home recently built specifically for them by hawthornes uncles richard and robert manning in raymond maine near sebago lake 
years later hawthorne looked back at his time in maine fondly those were delightful days for that part of the country was wild then with only scattered clearings and nine tenths of it primeval woods 
in NUM he was sent back to salem for school and soon complained of homesickness and being too far from his mother and sisters 
he distributed seven issues of the spectator to his family in august and september NUM for the sake of having fun 
the homemade newspaper was written by hand and included essays poems and news featuring the young authors adolescent humor 
hawthornes uncle robert manning insisted that the boy attend college despite hawthornes protests 
with the financial support of his uncle hawthorne was sent to bowdoin college in NUM partly because of family connections in the area and also because of its relatively inexpensive tuition rate 
hawthorne met future president franklin pierce on the way to bowdoin at the stage stop in portland and the two became fast friends 
once at the school he also met future poet henry wadsworth longfellow future congressman jonathan cilley and future naval reformer horatio bridge

he was offered an appointment as weigher and gauger at the boston custom house at a salary of NUM a year which he accepted on january NUM NUM
during his time there he rented a room from george stillman hillard business partner of charles sumner 
hawthorne wrote in the comparative obscurity of what he called his owls nest in the family home 
as he looked back on this period of his life he wrote i have not lived but only dreamed about living 
he contributed short stories to various magazines and annuals including young goodman brown and the ministers black veil though none drew major attention to him 
horatio bridge offered to cover the risk of collecting these stories in the spring of NUM into the volume twice-told tales which made hawthorne known locally 
while at bowdoin hawthorne wagered a bottle of madeira wine with his friend jonathan cilley that cilley would get married before hawthorne did 
by NUM he had won the bet but he did not remain a bachelor for life 
he had public flirtations with mary silsbee and elizabeth peabody then he began pursuing peabodys sister illustrator and transcendentalist sophia peabody 
he joined the transcendentalist utopian community at brook farm in NUM not because he agreed with the experiment but because it helped him save money to marry sophia 
he paid a NUM deposit and was put in charge of shoveling the hill of manure referred to as the gold mine
he left later that year though his brook farm adventure became an inspiration for his novel the blithedale romance
hawthorne married sophia peabody on july NUM NUM at a ceremony in the peabody parlor on west street in boston 
the couple moved to the old manse in concord massachusetts where they lived for three years 
his neighbor ralph waldo emerson invited him into his social circle but hawthorne was almost pathologically shy and stayed silent at gatherings 
at the old manse hawthorne wrote most of the tales collected in mosses from an old manse
like hawthorne sophia was a reclusive person 
throughout her early life she had frequent migraines and underwent several experimental medical treatments 
she was mostly bedridden until her sister introduced her to hawthorne after which her headaches seem to have abated 
the hawthornes enjoyed a long and happy marriage 
he referred to her as his dove and wrote that she is in the strictest sense my sole companion and i need no otherthere is no vacancy in my mind any more than in my heart .
thank god that i suffice for her boundless heart
sophia greatly admired her husbands work 
she wrote in one of her journals
i am always so dazzled and bewildered with the richness the depth the  .. jewels of beauty in his productions that i am always looking forward to a second reading where i can ponder and muse and fully take in the miraculous wealth of thoughts 
poet ellery channing came to the old manse for help on the first anniversary of the hawthornes marriage 
a local teenager named martha hunt had drowned herself in the river and hawthornes boat pond lily was needed to find her body 
hawthorne helped recover the corpse which he described as a spectacle of such perfect horror .. she was the very image of death-agony
the incident later inspired a scene in his novel the blithedale romance
the hawthornes had three children 
their first was daughter una born march NUM NUM her name was a reference to the faerie queene to the displeasure of family members 
hawthorne wrote to a friend i find it a very sober and serious kind of happiness that springs from the birth of a child .
there is no escaping it any longer 
i have business on earth now and must look about me for the means of doing it 
in october NUM the hawthornes moved to salem

daughter rose was born in may NUM and hawthorne called her his autumnal flower
in april NUM hawthorne was officially appointed as the surveyor for the district of salem and beverly and inspector of the revenue for the port of salem at an annual salary of NUM
he had difficulty writing during this period as he admitted to longfellow

i am trying to resume my pen .
whenever i sit alone or walk alone i find myself dreaming about stories as of old but these forenoons in the custom house undo all that the afternoons and evenings have done 
i should be happier if i could write 
this employment like his earlier appointment to the custom house in boston was vulnerable to the politics of the spoils system 
hawthorne was a democrat and lost this job due to the change of administration in washington after the presidential election of NUM
he wrote a letter of protest to the boston daily advertiser which was attacked by the whigs and supported by the democrats making hawthornes dismissal a much-talked about event in new england 
he was deeply affected by the death of his mother in late july calling it the darkest hour i ever lived
he was appointed the corresponding secretary of the salem lyceum in NUM
guests who came to speak that season included emerson thoreau louis agassiz and theodore parker 
hawthorne returned to writing and published the scarlet letter in mid-march NUM including a preface that refers to his three-year tenure in the custom house and makes several allusions to local politicianswho did not appreciate their treatment 
it was one of the first mass-produced books in america selling NUM volumes within ten days and earning hawthorne NUM over NUM years 
the book was pirated by booksellers in london and became a best-seller in the united states it initiated his most lucrative period as a writer 
hawthornes friend edwin percy whipple objected to the novels morbid intensity and its dense psychological details writing that the book is therefore apt to become like hawthorne too painfully anatomical in his exhibition of them though NUMth-century writer d h lawrence said that there could be no more perfect work of the american imagination than the scarlet letter
hawthorne and his family moved to a small red farmhouse near lenox massachusetts at the end of march NUM
he became friends with herman melville beginning on august NUM NUM when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend 
melville had just read hawthornes short story collection mosses from an old manse and his unsigned review of the collection was printed in the literary world on august NUM and august NUM entitled hawthorne and his mosses
melville was composing moby-dick at the time and he wrote that these stories revealed a dark side to hawthorne shrouded in blackness ten times black
melville dedicated moby-dick NUM to hawthorne in token of my admiration for his genius this book is inscribed to nathaniel hawthorne 
hawthornes time in the berkshires was very productive 
while there he wrote the house of the seven gables NUM which poet and critic james russell lowell said was better than the scarlet letter and called the most valuable contribution to new england history that has been made 
he also wrote the blithedale romance NUM his only work written in the first person 
he also published a wonder-book for girls and boys in NUM a collection of short stories retelling myths which he had been thinking about writing since NUM
nevertheless poet ellery channing reported that hawthorne has suffered much living in this place
the family enjoyed the scenery of the berkshires although hawthorne did not enjoy the winters in their small house 
they left on november NUM NUM
hawthorne noted i am sick to death of berkshire .
i have felt languid and dispirited during almost my whole residence 
in may NUM the hawthornes returned to concord where they lived until july NUM
in february they bought the hillside a home previously inhabited by amos bronson alcott and his family and renamed it the wayside 
their neighbors in concord included emerson and henry david thoreau 
that year hawthorne wrote the life of franklin pierce the campaign biography of his friend which depicted him as a man of peaceful pursuits
horace mann said if he makes out pierce to be a great man or a brave man it will be the greatest work of fiction he ever wrote 
in the biography hawthorne depicts pierce as a statesman and soldier who had accomplished no great feats because of his need to make little noise and so withdrew into the background
he also left out pierces drinking habits despite rumors of his alcoholism and emphasized pierces belief that slavery could not be remedied by human contrivances but would over time vanish like a dream
with pierces election as president hawthorne was rewarded in NUM with the position of united states consul in liverpool shortly after the publication of tanglewood tales
the role was considered the most lucrative foreign service position at the time described by hawthornes wife as second in dignity to the embassy in london
his appointment ended in NUM at the close of the pierce administration and the hawthorne family toured france and italy 
during his time in italy the previously clean-shaven hawthorne grew a bushy mustache 
the family returned to the wayside in NUM and that year saw the publication of the marble faun his first new book in seven years 
hawthorne admitted that he had aged considerably referring to himself as wrinkled with time and trouble
at the outset of the american civil war hawthorne traveled with william d ticknor to washington dc where he met abraham lincoln and other notable figures 
he wrote about his experiences in the essay chiefly about war matters in NUM
failing health prevented him from completing several more romances 
hawthorne was suffering from pain in his stomach and insisted on a recuperative trip with his friend franklin pierce though his neighbor bronson alcott was concerned that hawthorne was too ill 
while on a tour of the white mountains he died in his sleep on may NUM NUM in plymouth new hampshire 
pierce sent a telegram to elizabeth peabody asking her to inform mrs hawthorne in person 
mrs hawthorne was too saddened by the news to handle the funeral arrangements herself 
hawthornes son julian was a freshman at harvard college and he learned of his fathers death the next day coincidentally he was initiated into the delta kappa epsilon fraternity on the same day by being blindfolded and placed in a coffin 
longfellow wrote a tribute poem to hawthorne published in NUM called 
hawthorne was buried on what is now known as authors ridge in sleepy hollow cemetery concord massachusetts 
pallbearers included longfellow emerson alcott oliver wendell holmes sr  james thomas fields and edwin percy whipple 
emerson wrote of the funeral i thought there was a tragic element in the event that might be more fully renderedin the painful solitude of the man which i suppose could no longer be endured  he died of it 
his wife sophia and daughter una were originally buried in england 
however in june NUM they were reinterred in plots adjacent to hawthorne 
hawthorne had a particularly close relationship with his publishers william ticknor and james thomas fields 
hawthorne once told fields i care more for your good opinion than for that of a host of critics 
in fact it was fields who convinced hawthorne to turn the scarlet letter into a novel rather than a short story 
ticknor handled many of hawthornes personal matters including the purchase of cigars overseeing financial accounts and even purchasing clothes 
ticknor died with hawthorne at his side in philadelphia in NUM according to a friend hawthorne was left apparently dazed
hawthornes works belong to romanticism or more specifically dark romanticism cautionary tales that suggest that guilt sin and evil are the most inherent natural qualities of humanity 
many of his works are inspired by puritan new england combining historical romance loaded with symbolism and deep psychological themes bordering on surrealism 
his depictions of the past are a version of historical fiction used only as a vehicle to express common themes of ancestral sin guilt and retribution 
his later writings also reflect his negative view of the transcendentalism movement 
hawthorne was predominantly a short story writer in his early career 
upon publishing twice-told tales however he noted i do not think much of them and he expected little response from the public 
his four major romances were written between NUM and NUM the scarlet letter NUM the house of the seven gables NUM the blithedale romance NUM and the marble faun NUM
another novel-length romance fanshawe was published anonymously in NUM
hawthorne defined a romance as being radically different from a novel by not being concerned with the possible or probable course of ordinary experience 
in the preface to the house of the seven gables hawthorne describes his romance-writing as using atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture
critics have applied feminist perspectives and historicist approaches to hawthornes depictions of women 
feminist scholars are interested particularly in hester prynne who realized that she herself could not be the destined prophetess but that angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman 
camille paglia saw hester as mystical a wandering goddess still bearing the mark of her asiatic origins  .. moving serenely in the magic circle of her sexual nature
lauren berlant termed hester the citizen as woman personifying love as a quality of the body that contains the purest light of nature her resulting traitorous political theory a female symbolic literalization of futile puritan metaphors 
historicists view hester as a protofeminist and avatar of the self-reliance and responsibility that led to womens suffrage and reproductive emancipation 
anthony splendora found her literary genealogy among other archetypally fallen but redeemed women both historic and mythic 
as examples he offers psyche of ancient legend heloise of twelfth-century frances tragedy involving world-renowned philosopher peter abelard anne hutchinson americas first heretic circa NUM and hawthorne family friend margaret fuller 
in hesters first appearance hawthorne likens her infant at her bosom to mary mother of jesus the image of divine maternity
in her study of victorian literature in which such galvanic outcasts as hester feature prominently nina auerbach went so far as to name hesters fall and subsequent redemption the novels one unequivocally religious activity
regarding hester as a deity figure meredith a 
powers found in hesters characterization the earliest in american fiction that the archetypal goddess appears quite graphically like a goddess not the wife of traditional marriage permanently subject to a male overlord powers noted her syncretism her flexibility her inherent ability to alter and so avoid the defeat of secondary status in a goal-oriented civilization
aside from hester prynne the model women of hawthornes other novels  from ellen langton of fanshawe to zenobia and priscilla of the blithedale romance hilda and miriam of the marble faun and phoebe and hepzibah of the house of the seven gables  are more fully realized than his male characters who merely orbit them 
this observation is equally true of his short-stories in which central females serve as allegorical figures rappaccinis beautiful but life-altering garden-bound daughter almost-perfect georgiana of the birthmark the sinned-against abandoned ester of ethan brand and goodwife faith brown linchpin of young goodman browns very belief in god 
my faith is gone
brown exclaims in despair upon seeing his wife at the witches sabbath .

hawthorne also wrote nonfiction 
in NUM library of america selected hawthornes a show of wax-figures for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of american true crime 
edgar allan poe wrote important and somewhat unflattering reviews of both twice-told tales and mosses from an old manse
poes negative assessment was partly due to his own contempt of allegory and moral tales and his chronic accusations of plagiarism though he admitted

the style of mr hawthorne is purity itself 
his tone is singularly effectivewild plaintive thoughtful and in full accordance with his themes .. we look upon him as one of the few men of indisputable genius to whom our country has as yet given birth 
ralph waldo emerson wrote nathaniel hawthornes reputation as a writer is a very pleasing fact because his writing is not good for anything and this is a tribute to the man 
henry james praised hawthorne saying the fine thing in hawthorne is that he cared for the deeper psychology and that in his way he tried to become familiar with it 
poet john greenleaf whittier wrote that he admired the weird and subtle beauty in hawthornes tales 
evert augustus duyckinck said of hawthorne of the american writers destined to live he is the most original the one least indebted to foreign models or literary precedents of any kind 
contemporary response to hawthornes work praised his sentimentality and moral purity while more modern evaluations focus on the dark psychological complexity 
beginning in the NUMs critics have focused on symbolism and didacticism 
the critic harold bloom has opined that only henry james and william faulkner challenge hawthornes position as the greatest american novelist although he admits that he favors james as the greatest american novelist 
bloom sees hawthornes greatest works to be principally the scarlet letter followed by the marble faun and certain short stories including my kinsman major molineux young goodman brown wakefield and feathertop
the definitive edition of hawthornes works is the centenary edition of the works of nathaniel hawthorne edited by william charvat and others published by the ohio state university press in twenty-three volumes between NUM and NUM

together the two briefly led what pynchon has called a micro-cult around oakley halls NUM novel warlock
pynchon later reminisced about his college days in the introduction he wrote in NUM for farias novel been down so long it looks like up to me first published in NUM
he reportedly attended lectures given by vladimir nabokov who then taught literature at cornell 
although nabokov later said that he had no memory of pynchon nabokovs wife vra who graded her husbands class papers commented that she remembered his distinctive handwriting as a mixture of printed and cursive letters half printing half script 
in NUM pynchon and classmate kirkpatrick sale wrote part or all of a science-fiction musical minstrel island which portrayed a dystopian future in which ibm rules the world 
pynchon received his ba in june NUM
after leaving cornell pynchon began to work on his first novel v
from february NUM to september NUM he was employed as a technical writer at boeing in seattle where he compiled safety articles for the bomarc service news a support newsletter for the bomarc surface-to-air missile deployed by the us air force 
pynchons experiences at boeing inspired his depictions of the yoyodyne corporation in v  and the crying of lot NUM and both his background in physics and the technical journalism he undertook at boeing provided much raw material for gravitys rainbow
when published in NUM v  won a william faulkner foundation award for the best first novel of the year 
it was a finalist for the national book award 
after resigning from boeing pynchon spent some time in new york and mexico before moving to california where he was reportedly based for much of the NUMs and early NUMs most notably in an apartment in manhattan beach as he was composing the highly regarded gravitys rainbow
pynchon during this time flirted with the lifestyle and some of the habits of the beat and hippie countercultures 
a negative aspect that pynchon retrospectively found in the hippie cultural and literary movement both in the form of the beats of the NUMs and the resurgence form of the NUMs was that it placed too much emphasis on youth including the eternal variety 
in NUM his application to study mathematics as a graduate student at the university of california berkeley was turned down 
in NUM pynchon wrote a first-hand report on the aftermath and legacy of the watts riots in los angeles 
titled a journey into the mind of watts the article was published in the new york times magazine
from the mid-NUMs pynchon has also regularly provided blurbs and introductions for a wide range of novels and non-fiction works 
one of the first of these pieces was a brief review of oakley halls warlock which appeared along with comments by seven other writers on neglected books as part of a feature titled a gift of books in the december NUM issue of holiday
in NUM pynchon was one of NUM signatories to the writers and editors war tax protest
full-page advertisements in the new york post and the new york review of books listed the names of those who had pledged not to pay the proposed NUM income tax surcharge or any war-designated tax increase and stated their belief that american involvement in vietnam is morally wrong
in an april NUM letter to his agent candida donadio pynchon wrote that he was facing a creative crisis with four novels in progress announcing if they come out on paper anything like they are inside my head then it will be the literary event of the millennium 
in the mid-NUMs pynchon lived at NUM NUMrd st in manhattan beach california in a small downstairs apartment 
in december NUM pynchon politely turned down an invitation from stanley edgar hyman to teach literature at bennington college writing that he had resolved two or three years earlier to write three novels at once 
pynchon described the decision as a moment of temporary insanity but noted that he was too stubborn to let any of them go let alone all of them 
pynchons second novel the crying of lot NUM was published a few months later in NUM
whether it was one of the three or four novels pynchon had in progress is not known but in a NUM letter to donadio pynchon had written that he was in the middle of writing a potboiler
when the book grew to NUM pages he called it a short story but with gland trouble and hoped that donadio could unload it on some poor sucker 
the crying of lot NUM won the richard and hilda rosenthal foundation award shortly after publication 
although more concise and linear in its structure than pynchons other novels its labyrinthine plot features an ancient underground mail service known as the tristero or trystero a parody of a jacobean revenge drama called the couriers tragedy and a corporate conspiracy involving the bones of world war ii american gis being used as charcoal cigarette filters 
it proposes a series of seemingly incredible interconnections between these events and other similarly bizarre revelations that confront the novels protagonist oedipa maas 
like v  the novel contains a wealth of references to science and technology and to obscure historical events with both books dwelling on the detritus of american society and culture 
the crying of lot NUM also continues pynchons strategy of composing parodic song lyrics and punning names and referencing aspects of popular culture within his prose narratives 
in particular it incorporates a very direct allusion to the protagonist of nabokovs lolita within the lyric of a love lament sung by a member of the paranoids an american teenage band who deliberately sing their songs with british accents p NUM
pynchons most celebrated novel is his third gravitys rainbow published in NUM
an intricate and allusive fiction that combines and elaborates on many of the themes of his earlier work including preterition paranoia racism colonialism conspiracy synchronicity and entropy the novel has spawned a wealth of commentary and critical material including readers guides books and scholarly articles online concordances and discussions and art works 
its artistic value is often compared to that of james joyces ulysses
some scholars have hailed it as the greatest american post-wwNUM novel and it has similarly been described as literally an anthology of postmodernist themes and devices
the major portion of gravitys rainbow takes place in london and europe in the final months of world war ii and the weeks immediately following ve day and is narrated for the most part from within the historical moment in which it is set 
in this way pynchons text enacts a type of dramatic irony whereby neither the characters nor the various narrative voices are aware of specific historical circumstances such as the holocaust and except as hints premonitions and mythography the complicity between western corporate interests and the nazi war machine which figure prominently in readers apprehensions of the novels historical context 
for example at wars end the narrator observes there are rumors of a war crimes tribunal under way in nrnberg 
no one slothrop has listened to is clear whos trying whom for what  ..  p NUM such an approach generates dynamic tension and moments of acute self-consciousness as both reader and author seem drawn ever deeper into the plot in various senses of that term

the novel invokes anti-authority sentiments often through violations of narrative conventions and integrity 
for example as the aforementioned protagonist tyrone slothrop considers the fact that his own family made its money killing trees he apostrophizes his apology and plea for advice to the coppice within which he has momentarily taken refuge 
in an overt incitement to eco-activism pynchons narrative agency then has it that a medium-sized pine nearby nods its top and suggests next time you come across a logging operation out here find one of their tractors that isnt being guarded and take its oil filter with you 
thats what you can do 
p NUM

encyclopedic in scope and often self-conscious in style the novel displays erudition in its treatment of an array of material drawn from the fields of psychology chemistry mathematics history religion music literature and film 
pynchon wrote the first draft of gravitys rainbow in neat tiny script on engineers quadrille paper
pynchon worked on the novel throughout the NUMs and early NUMs while he was living in california and mexico city 
gravitys rainbow shared the NUM national book award with a crown of feathers and other stories by isaac bashevis singer split award
that same year the pulitzer prize fiction panel unanimously recommended gravitys rainbow for the award but the pulitzer board vetoed the jurys recommendation describing the novel as unreadable turgid overwritten and in parts obscene
no pulitzer prize for fiction was awarded and finalists were not announced before NUM.
in NUM pynchon declined the william dean howells medal 
a collection of pynchons early short stories slow learner was published in NUM with a lengthy autobiographical introduction 
in october of the same year an article titled is it ok 
to be a luddite
was published in the new york times book review
in april NUM pynchon contributed an extensive review of gabriel garca mrquezs novel love in the time of cholera to the new york times under the title the hearts eternal vow
another article titled nearer my couch to thee was published in june NUM in the new york times book review as one in a series of articles in which various writers reflected on each of the seven deadly sins 
pynchons subject was sloth
pynchons fourth novel vineland was published in NUM but disappointed some fans and critics 
it did however receive a positive review from the novelist salman rushdie 
the novel is set in california in the NUMs and NUMs and describes the relationship between an fbi cointelpro agent and a female radical filmmaker 
its strong socio-political undercurrents detail the constant battle between authoritarianism and communalism and the nexus between resistance and complicity but with a typically pynchonian sense of humor 
in NUM he received a macarthur fellowship and since the early NUMs at least he has been frequently cited as a contender for the nobel prize in literature 
american literary critic harold bloom named him as one of the four major american novelists of his time along with don delillo philip roth and cormac mccarthy 
pynchons fifth novel mason  dixon was published in NUM though it had been a work in progress since at least january NUM
the meticulously researched novel is a sprawling postmodernist saga recounting the lives and careers of the english astronomer charles mason and his partner the surveyor jeremiah dixon the surveyors of the mason-dixon line during the birth of the american republic 
some commentators acknowledged it as a welcome return to form 
the american critic harold bloom hailed the novel as pynchons masterpiece to date
a variety of rumors pertaining to the subject matter of against the day circulated for a number of years 
most specific of these were comments made by the former german minister of culture michael naumann who stated that he assisted pynchon in his research about a russian mathematician who studied for david hilbert in gttingen and that the new novel would trace the life and loves of sofia kovalevskaya 
in july NUM a new untitled novel by pynchon was announced along with a synopsis written by pynchon himself which appeared on amazoncom it stated that the novels action takes place between the NUM chicago worlds fair and the time immediately following world war i 
with a worldwide disaster looming just a few years ahead pynchon wrote in his book description it is a time of unrestrained corporate greed false religiosity moronic fecklessness and evil intent in high places 
no reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred 
he promised cameos by nikola tesla bela lugosi and groucho marx as well as stupid songs and strange sexual practices
subsequently the title of the new book was reported to be against the day and a penguin spokesperson confirmed that the synopsis was pynchons 
against the day was released on november NUM NUM and is NUM pages long in the first edition hardcover 
the book was given almost no promotion by penguin and professional book reviewers were given little time in advance to review the book 
an edited version of pynchons synopsis was used as the jacket-flap copy and kovalevskaya does appear although as only one of over a hundred characters 
composed in part of a series of interwoven pastiches of popular fiction genres from the era in which it is set the novel inspired mixed reactions from critics and reviewers 
one reviewer remarked it is brilliant but it is exhaustingly brilliant 
other reviewers described against the day as lengthy and rambling and a baggy monster of a book while negative appraisals condemned the novel for its silliness or characterized its action as fairly pointless and remained unimpressed by its grab bag of themes
inherent vice was published in august NUM
a synopsis and brief extract from the novel along with the novels title inherent vice and dust jacket image were printed in penguin press summer NUM catalogue 
the book was advertised by the publisher as part-noir part-psychedelic romp all thomas pynchonprivate eye doc sportello comes occasionally out of a cannabis haze to watch the end of an era as free love slips away and paranoia creeps in with the la 
fog 
a promotional video for the novel was released by penguin books on august NUM NUM with the character voiceover narrated by the author himself 
a film adaptation inherent vice by writer-director paul thomas anderson premiered in december NUM and received two oscar nominations 
on january NUM NUM washington post editor ron charles announced via twitter that pynchon was set to publish a new novel titled the bleeding edge according to his publisher penguin press 
on february NUM NUM penguin stated the new novel bleeding edge would take place in manhattans silicon alley during the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of september NUM.
the novel was published on september NUM NUM to positive reviews 
poet l e sissman wrote from the new yorker he is almost a mathematician of prose who calculates the least and the greatest stress each word and line each pun and ambiguity can bear and applies his knowledge accordingly and virtually without lapses though he takes many scary bracing linguistic risks 
thus his remarkably supple diction can first treat of a painful and delicate love scene and then roar without pause into the sounds and echoes of a drugged and drunken orgy 
pynchons style is commonly classified as postmodernist 
along with its emphasis on sociopolitical themes such as racism and imperialism its awareness and appropriation of many elements of traditional high culture and literary form pynchons work explores philosophical theological and sociological ideas exhaustively though in quirky and approachable ways 
his writings demonstrate a strong affinity with the practitioners and artifacts of low culture including comic books and cartoons pulp fiction popular films television programs cookery urban myths paranoia and conspiracy theories and folk art 
this blurring of the conventional boundary between high and low culture has been seen as one of the defining characteristics of his writing 
in particular pynchon has revealed himself in his fiction and non-fiction as an aficionado of popular music 
song lyrics and mock musical numbers appear in each of his novels and in his autobiographical introduction to the slow learner collection of early stories he reveals a fondness for both jazz and rock and roll 
the character mcclintic sphere in v  is a fictional composite of jazz musicians such as ornette coleman charlie parker and thelonious monk 
in the crying of lot NUM the lead singer of the paranoids sports a beatle haircut and sings with an english accent 
in the closing pages of gravitys rainbow there is an apocryphal report that tyrone slothrop the novels protagonist played kazoo and harmonica as a guest musician on a record released by the fool in the NUMs having magically recovered the latter instrument his harp in a german stream in NUM after losing it down the toilet in NUM at the roseland ballroom in roxbury boston to the strains of the jazz standard cherokee upon which tune charlie parker was simultaneously inventing bebop in new york as pynchon describes
in vineland both zoyd wheeler and isaiah two four are also musicians zoyd played keyboards in a NUMs surf band called the corvairs while isaiah played in a punk band called billy barf and the vomitones 
in mason  dixon one of the characters plays on the clavier the varsity drinking song that will later become the star-spangled banner while in another episode a character remarks tangentially sometimes its hard to be a woman
in his introduction to slow learner pynchon acknowledges a debt to the anarchic bandleader spike jones and in NUM he penned a NUM-word set of liner notes for the album spiked
 a collection of joness recordings released on the short-lived bmg catalyst label 
pynchon also wrote the liner notes for nobodys cool the second album of indie rock band lotion in which he states that rock and roll remains one of the last honorable callings and a working band is a miracle of everyday life 
which is basically what these guys do
he is also known to be a fan of roky erickson  
investigations and digressions into the realms of human sexuality psychology sociology mathematics science and technology recur throughout pynchons works 
one of his earliest short stories low-lands NUM features a meditation on heisenbergs uncertainty principle as a metaphor for telling stories about ones own experiences 
his next published work entropy NUM introduced the concept which was to become synonymous with pynchons name though pynchon later admitted the shallowness of his understanding of the subject and noted that choosing an abstract concept first and trying to construct a narrative around it was a lousy way to go about writing a story
another early story under the rose NUM includes among its cast of characters a cyborg set anachronistically in victorian-era egypt a type of writing now called steampunk
this story significantly reworked by pynchon appears as chapter NUM of v  the secret integration NUM pynchons last published short story is a sensitively handled coming-of-age tale in which a group of young boys face the consequences of the american policy of racial integration 
at one point in the story the boys attempt to understand the new policy by way of the mathematical operation the only sense of the word with which they are familiar 
the crying of lot NUM also alludes to entropy and communication theory and contains scenes and descriptions which parody or appropriate calculus zenos paradoxes and the thought experiment known as maxwells demon 
at the same time the novel also investigates homosexuality celibacy and both medically sanctioned and illicit psychedelic drug use 
gravitys rainbow describes many varieties of sexual fetishism including sado-masochism coprophilia and a borderline case of tentacle erotica and features numerous episodes of drug use most notably cannabis but also cocaine naturally occurring hallucinogens and the mushroom amanita muscaria 
gravitys rainbow also derives much from pynchons background in mathematics at one point the geometry of garter belts is compared with that of cathedral spires both described as mathematical singularities 
mason  dixon explores the scientific theological and socio-cultural foundations of the age of reason while also depicting the relationships between actual historical figures and fictional characters in intricate detail and like gravitys rainbow is an archetypal example of the genre of historiographic metafiction 
an eclectic catalogue of pynchonian precursors has been proposed by readers and critics 
pynchons novels refer overtly to writers as disparate as
henry adams jorge luis borges giorgio de chirico emily dickinson umberto eco ralph waldo emerson william march vladimir nabokov patrick obrian ishmael reed rainer maria rilke and ludwig wittgenstein and to a mix of iconic religious and philosophical sources 
critics have made comparisons of pynchons writing with works by
rabelais
cervantes
laurence sterne
edgar allan poe
nathaniel hawthorne
herman melville
charles dickens
joseph conrad
thomas mann
william s burroughs
ralph ellison
patrick white and
toni morrison 
some commentators have detected similarities with those writers in the modernist tradition who wrote long novels dealing with large metaphysical or political issues 
examples of such works might include ulysses by james joyce
a passage to india by em forster
the apes of god by wyndham lewis
the man without qualities by robert musil and
us a  by john dos passos 
pynchon explicitly acknowledges his debt to beat generation writers and expresses his admiration for jack kerouacs on the road in particular 
he also outlines the specific influence on his own early fiction of literary works by t s eliot ernest hemingway henry miller saul bellow herbert gold philip roth norman mailer john buchan and graham greene and non-fiction works by helen waddell norbert wiener and isaac asimov 
younger contemporary writers who have been touted as heirs to pynchon include david foster wallace william vollmann richard powers steve erickson david mitchell neal stephenson dave eggers and tommaso pincio whose pseudonym is an italian rendering of pynchons name 
pynchons work has been cited as an influence and inspiration by many writers directors and artists including

thanks to his influence on gibson and stephenson in particular pynchon became one of the progenitors of cyberpunk fiction a NUM essay in spin magazine by timothy leary explicitly named gravitys rainbow as the old testament of cyberpunk with gibsons neuromancer and its sequels as the new testament
though the term cyberpunk did not become prevalent until the early NUMs since learys article many readers have retroactively included gravitys rainbow in the genre along with other workseg  samuel r delanys dhalgren and many works of philip k dickwhich seem after the fact to anticipate cyberpunk styles and themes 
the encyclopedic nature of pynchons novels also led to some attempts to link his work with the short-lived hypertext fiction movement of the NUMs 
the main-belt asteroid NUM is named after pynchon 
relatively little is known about pynchons private life he has carefully avoided contact with reporters for more than forty years 
only a few photos of him are known to exist nearly all from his high school and college days and his whereabouts have often remained undisclosed 
a review of v  in the new york times book review described pynchon as a recluse living in mexico thereby introducing the media label with which journalists have characterized him throughout his career 
nonetheless pynchons personal absence from mass media is one of the notable features of his life and it has generated many rumors and apocryphal anecdotes 
after the publication and success of gravitys rainbow interest mounted in finding out more about the identity of the author 
at the NUM national book awards ceremony the president of viking press tom guinzberg arranged for double-talking comedian professor irwin corey to accept the prize on pynchons behalf 
many of the assembled guests had no idea who corey was and had never seen the author so they assumed it was pynchon himself on the stage delivering coreys trademark torrent of rambling pseudo-scholarly verbiage 
toward the end of coreys address a streaker ran through the hall adding further to the confusion 
an article published in the soho weekly news claimed that pynchon was in fact j d salinger 
pynchons written response to this theory was simple not bad 
keep trying 
thereafter the first piece to provide substantial information about pynchons personal life was a biographical account written by a former cornell university friend jules siegel and published in playboy magazine 
in his article siegel reveals that pynchon had a complex about his teeth and underwent extensive and painful reconstructive surgery was nicknamed tom at cornell and attended mass diligently acted as best man at siegels wedding and that he later also had an affair with siegels wife 
siegel recalls pynchon saying he did attend some of vladimir nabokovs lectures at cornell but that he could hardly make out what nabokov was saying because of his thick russian accent 
siegel also records pynchons commenting every weirdo in the world is on my wavelength an observation borne out by the crankiness and zealotry that has attached itself to his name and work in subsequent years 
pynchon does not like to talk with reporters and refuses the spectacle of celebrity and public appearances 
journalists have continued to speculate about his identity and activities and characterized his mass media avoidance as reclusive
some readers and critics have suggested that there were and are perhaps aesthetic and ideological motivations behind his choice to remain aloof from public life 
for example the protagonist in janette turner hospitals short story for mr voss or occupant published in NUM explains to her daughter that she is writing

more recently book critic arthur salm has written that

belying this reputation somewhat pynchon has published a number of articles and reviews in the mainstream american media including words of support for salman rushdie and his then-wife marianne wiggins after the fatwa was pronounced against rushdie by the iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
in the following year rushdies enthusiastic review of pynchons vineland prompted pynchon to send him another message hinting that if rushdie were ever in new york the two should arrange a meeting 
eventually the two did meet and rushdie said of him that he was extremely pynchon-esque and the pynchon he wanted him to be 
in the early NUMs pynchon married his literary agent melanie jacksona great-granddaughter of theodore roosevelt and a granddaughter of robert h jackson us supreme court justice and nuremberg trials prosecutorand fathered a son jackson in NUM
the disclosure of pynchons NUMs location in new york city after many years in which he was believed to be dividing his time between mexico and northern california led some journalists and photographers to try to track him down 
shortly before the publication of mason  dixon in NUM a cnn camera crew filmed him in manhattan 
angered by this invasion of his privacy he called cnn asking that he not be identified in the footage of the street scenes near his home 
when asked by cnn pynchon rejected their characterization of him as a recluse remarking my belief is that recluse is a code word generated by journalists  .. meaning doesnt like to talk to reporters.
cnn also quoted him as saying let me be unambiguous 
i prefer not to be photographed 
the next year a reporter for the sunday times managed to snap a photo of him as he was walking with his son 
after several references to pynchons work and reputation were made on nbcs the john larroquette show pynchon through his agent reportedly contacted the series producers to offer suggestions and corrections 
when a local pynchon sighting became a major plot point in a NUM episode of the series pynchon was sent the script for his approval as well as providing the title of a fictitious work to be used in one episode pandemonium of the sun the novelist apparently vetoed a final scene that called for an extra playing him to be filmed from behind walking away from the shot 
also during the NUMs pynchon befriended members of the band lotion and contributed liner notes for the bands NUM album nobodys cool
although the band initially claimed that he had seen them in concert and become a groupie in NUM they revealed to the new yorker that they met him through his accountant who was drummer rob youngbergs mother she gave him an advance copy of the album and he agreed to write the liner notes only later seeing them in concert 
the novelist then conducted an interview with the band lunch with lotion for esquire in june NUM in the lead-up to the publication of mason  dixon
more recently pynchon provided faxed answers to questions submitted by author david hajdu and permitted excerpts from his personal correspondence to be quoted in hajdus NUM book positively NUMth street the lives and times of joan baez bob dylan mimi baez faria and richard faria
pynchons insistence on maintaining his personal privacy and on having his work speak for itself has resulted in a number of outlandish rumors and hoaxes over the years 
indeed claims that pynchon was the unabomber or a sympathizer with the waco branch davidians after the NUM siege were upstaged in the mid-NUMs by the invention of an elaborate rumor insinuating that pynchon and one wanda tinasky were the same person 
a spate of letters authored under that name had appeared in the late NUMs in the anderson valley advertiser in anderson valley california 
the style and content of those letters were said to resemble pynchons and pynchons vineland published in NUM also takes place in northern california so it was suggested that pynchon may have been in the area at that time conducting research 
a collection of the tinasky letters was eventually published as a paperback book in NUM however pynchon himself denied having written the letters and no direct attribution of the letters to pynchon was ever made 
literary detective donald foster subsequently showed that the letters were in fact written by an obscure beat writer tom hawkins who had murdered his wife and then committed suicide in NUM
fosters evidence was conclusive including finding the typewriter on which the tinasky letters had been written 
in NUM over NUM letters that pynchon had written to his longtime agent candida donadio were donated by the family of a private collector carter burden to the pierpont morgan library in new york city 
the letters ranged from NUM to NUM thus covering some of the authors most creative and prolific years 
although the morgan library originally intended to allow scholars to view the letters at pynchons request the burden family and morgan library agreed to seal these letters until after pynchons death 
responding to the image which has been manufactured in the media over the years pynchon made two cameo animated appearances on the television series the simpsons in NUM
the first occurs in the episode diatribe of a mad housewife in which marge simpson becomes a novelist 
he plays himself with a paper bag over his head and provides a blurb for the back cover of marges book speaking in a broad long island accent heres your quote thomas pynchon loved this book almost as much as he loves cameras
he then starts yelling at passing cars hey over here have your picture taken with a reclusive author
today only well throw in a free autograph
but wait
theres more
in his second appearance in alls fair in oven war pynchons dialogue consists entirely of puns on his novel titles these wings are v-licious
ill put this recipe in the gravitys rainbow cookbook right next to the frying of latke NUM.
the cartoon representation of pynchon reappears in a third non-speaking cameo as a guest at the fictional wordloaf convention depicted in the NUMth season episode moena lisa
the episode first aired on november NUM NUM the sunday before pynchons sixth novel against the day was released 
according to al jean on the NUMth season dvd episode commentary pynchon wanted to do the series because his son was a big fan 
it was revealed on august NUM NUM that during pre-production of alls fair in oven war pynchon faxed one page from the script to producer matt selman with several handwritten edits to his lines 
of particular emphasis was pynchons outright refusal to utter the line no wonder homer is such a fat-ass 
pynchons objection apparently had nothing to do with the salty language as he explained in a footnote to the edit ...homer is my role model and i cant speak ill of him 
in celebration of the NUMth anniversary of george orwells birth pynchon wrote a new foreword to orwells celebrated dystopian novel nineteen eighty-four
the introduction presents a brief biography of orwell as well as a reflection on some of the critical responses to nineteen eighty-four
pynchon also offers his own reflection in the introduction that what is perhaps most important indeed necessary to a working prophet is to be able to see deeper than most of us into the human soul 
in july NUM amazoncom created a page showing an upcoming NUM-page untitled thomas pynchon novel 
a description of the soon-to-be published novel appeared on amazon purporting to be written by pynchon himself 
the description was taken down prompting speculation over its authenticity but the blurb was soon back up along with the title of pynchons new novel against the day
shortly before against the day was published pynchons prose appeared in the program for the daily show ten fuing years the concert a retrospective on jon stewarts comedy-news broadcast the daily show
on december NUM NUM pynchon joined a campaign by many other major authors to clear ian mcewan of plagiarism charges by sending a typewritten letter to his british publisher which was published in the daily telegraph newspaper 
pynchons NUM youtube promotional teaser for the novel inherent vice is the second time a recording of his voice has been released to mainstream outlets the first being his appearances on the simpsons
in NUM pynchons novels were released in e-book format ending a long holdout by the author 
publisher penguin press reported that the novels length and complex page layouts made it a challenge to convert them to a digital format 
though they had produced a promotional video for the june release penguin had no expectation pynchons public profile would change in any fashion 
in september NUM josh brolin told the new york times that pynchon had made a cameo in the inherent vice film 
this led to a sizable online hunt for the authors potential appearance eventually targeting actor charley morgan whose small role as a doctor led many to believe he was pynchon 
morgan son of mashs harry morgan claimed that paul thomas anderson whom he described as a friend had told him that such a cameo did not exist 
despite this nothing has been directly confirmed by anderson or warner bros pictures

vladimir nabokov

vladimir vladimirovich nabokov    also known by the pen name vladimir sirin NUM july NUM was a russian-american novelist translator and entomologist 
his first nine novels were in russian but he achieved international prominence after he began writing english prose 
nabokovs lolita NUM his most noted novel in english was ranked fourth in the list of the modern library NUM best novels pale fire NUM was ranked NUMrd on the same list and his memoir speak memory NUM was listed eighth on the publishers list of the NUMth centurys greatest nonfiction 
he was a finalist for the national book award for fiction seven times 
nabokov was an expert lepidopterist and composer of chess problems 
nabokov was born on NUM april NUM NUM april NUM old style in saint petersburg to a wealthy and prominent family of the russian nobility which traced its roots back to a fourteenth-century tatar prince nabok murza who entered into the service of the tsars and from whom the family name is derived 
his father was the liberal lawyer statesman and journalist vladimir dmitrievich nabokov NUM and his mother was the heiress yelena ivanovna ne rukavishnikova the granddaughter of a millionaire gold-mine owner 
his father was a leader of the pre-revolutionary liberal constitutional democratic party and authored numerous books and articles about criminal law and politics 
his cousins included the composer nicolas nabokov 
his paternal grandfather dmitry nabokov NUM had been russias justice minister in the reign of alexander ii 
his paternal grandmother was the baltic german baroness maria von korff NUM
through his fathers german ancestry he was also related to the music composer carl heinrich graun NUM
vladimir was the familys eldest and favorite child with four younger siblings sergey NUM olga NUM elena NUM and kiril NUM
sergey would be killed in a nazi concentration camp in NUM after he spoke out publicly denouncing hitlers regime 
olga is recalled by ayn rand her close friend at stoiunina gymnasium as having been a supporter of constitutional monarchy who had first awakened rands interest in politics 
the youngest daughter elena who would in later years become vladimirs favourite sibling published her correspondence with her brother in NUM and would become an important living source for later biographers of nabokov 
nabokov spent his childhood and youth in saint petersburg and at the country estate vyra near siverskaya to the south of the city 
his childhood which he had called perfect and cosmopolitan was remarkable in several ways 
the family spoke russian english and french in their household and nabokov was trilingual from an early age 
he relates that the first english book his mother read to him was misunderstood NUM by florence montgomery 
in fact much to his patriotic fathers disappointment nabokov could read and write in english before he could in russian 
in speak memory nabokov recalls numerous details of his privileged childhood and his ability to recall in vivid detail memories of his past was a boon to him during his permanent exile and it provided a theme that echoes from his first book mary to later works such as 
while the family was nominally orthodox they felt no religious fervor and vladimir was not forced to attend church after he lost interest 
in NUM nabokov inherited the estate rozhdestveno next to vyra from his uncle vasily ivanovich rukavishnikov uncle ruka in speak memory but lost it in the october revolution one year later this was the only house he ever owned 
nabokovs adolescence was also the period in which his first serious literary endeavors were made 
in NUM nabokov had his first collection of poetry published stikhi poems a collection of NUM russian poems 
at the time nabokov was attending tenishev school in saint petersburg where his literature teacher vladimir vasilievich gippius had been critical toward his literary accomplishments 
some time after the publication of stikhi zinaida gippius renowned poet and first cousin of vladimir gippius told nabokovs father at a social event please tell your son that he will never be a writer 
after the NUM february revolution nabokovs father became a secretary of the russian provisional government and after the october revolution the family was forced to flee the city for crimea not expecting to be away for very long 
they lived at a friends estate and in september NUM moved to livadiya at the time part of the ukrainian republic nabokovs father became a minister of justice in the crimean regional government 
after the withdrawal of the german army in november NUM and the defeat of the white army early NUM the nabokovs sought exile in western europe 
they settled briefly in england and vladimir enrolled in trinity college cambridge first studying zoology then slavic and romance languages 
his examination results on the first part of the tripos taken at the end of second year were a starred first 
he sat the second part of the exam in his fourth year just after his fathers death 
nabokov feared that he might fail the exam but his script was marked second-class 
his final examination result was second-class and his ba conferred in NUM
nabokov later drew on his cambridge experiences to write several works including the novels glory and the real life of sebastian knight
in NUM nabokovs family moved to berlin where his father set up the migr newspaper rul rudder
nabokov followed them to berlin two years later after completing his studies at cambridge 
in march NUM nabokovs father was fatally shot in berlin by the russian monarchist piotr shabelsky-bork as he was trying to shield the real target pavel milyukov a leader of the constitutional democratic party-in-exile 
this mistaken violent death would echo again and again in nabokovs fiction where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms 
in pale fire for example one interpretation of the novel has an assassin mistakenly kill the poet john shade when his actual target is a fugitive european monarch 
shortly after his fathers death nabokovs mother and sister moved to prague 
nabokov stayed in berlin where he had become a recognised poet and writer within the migr community and published under the nom de plume v sirin a reference to the fabulous bird of russian folklore
to supplement his scant writing income he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons 
of his fifteen berlin years dieter e zimmer has written he never became fond of berlin and at the end intensely disliked it 
he lived within the lively russian community of berlin that was more or less self-sufficient staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to 
he knew little german 
he knew few germans except for landladies shopkeepers the petty immigration officials at the police headquarters 
in NUM nabokov became engaged to svetlana siewert she broke off the engagement in early NUM her parents worrying that he could not provide for her 
in may NUM he met a russian-jewish woman vra evseyevna slonim at a charity ball in berlin and married her in april NUM
their only child dmitri was born in NUM
in NUM vra lost her job because of the increasingly anti-semitic environment also in that year the assassin of nabokovs father was appointed second-in-command of the russian migr group 
in the same year nabokov began seeking a job in the english-speaking world 
in NUM he left germany for france where he had a short affair with russian migre irina guadanini 
yet the family followed him to france making enroute their last visit to prague then spent time in cannes menton cap dantibes and frjus and finally settled together in paris 
in may NUM the nabokov family fled from the advancing german troops to the united states on board the ss champlain with the exception of nabokovs brother sergei who died at the neuengamme concentration camp on NUM january NUM
the nabokovs settled in manhattan and vladimir began volunteer work as an entomologist at the american museum of natural history 
nabokov joined the staff of wellesley college in NUM as resident lecturer in comparative literature 
the position created specifically for him provided an income and free time to write creatively and pursue his lepidoptery 
nabokov is remembered as the founder of wellesleys russian department 
the nabokovs resided in wellesley massachusetts during the NUM academic year 
in september NUM they moved to cambridge where they lived until june NUM
following a lecture tour through the united states nabokov returned to wellesley for the NUM academic year as a lecturer in russian 
in NUM he became a naturalized citizen of the united states 
he served through the NUM term as wellesleys one-man russian department offering courses in russian language and literature 
his classes were popular due as much to his unique teaching style as to the wartime interest in all things russian 
at the same time he was the de facto curator of lepidoptery at harvard universitys museum of comparative zoology 
after being encouraged by morris bishop nabokov left wellesley in NUM to teach russian and european literature at cornell university where he taught until NUM
among his students at cornell was future us supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg who later identified nabokov as a major influence on her development as a writer 
nabokov wrote lolita while travelling on butterfly-collection trips in the western united states that he undertook every summer 
vra acted as secretary typist editor proofreader translator and bibliographer his agent business manager legal counsel and chauffeur his research assistant teaching assistant and professorial understudy when nabokov attempted to burn unfinished drafts of lolita it was vra who stopped him 
he called her the best-humored woman he had ever known 
in june NUM nabokov and his family went to ashland oregon 
there he finished lolita and began writing the novel pnin
he roamed the nearby mountains looking for butterflies and wrote a poem called lines written in oregon
on NUM october NUM he and his family returned to ithaca new york where he would later teach the young writer thomas pynchon 
after the great financial success of lolita nabokov was able to return to europe and devote himself exclusively to writing 
his son had obtained a position as an operatic bass at reggio emilia 
on NUM october NUM he and vra moved to the montreux palace hotel in montreux switzerland he stayed there until the end of his life 
from his sixth-floor quarters he conducted his business and took tours to the alps corsica and sicily to hunt butterflies 
in NUM he was hospitalised with a fever doctors were unable to diagnose 
he was rehospitalised in lausanne in NUM suffering from severe bronchial congestion 
he died on NUM july in montreux surrounded by his family and according to his son dmitri with a triple moan of descending pitch
his remains were cremated and are buried at the clarens cemetery in montreux 
at the time of his death he was working on a novel titled the original of laura
his wife vra and son dmitri were entrusted with nabokovs literary executorship and though he asked them to burn the manuscript they chose not to destroy his final work 
the incomplete manuscript around NUM handwritten index cards long remained in a swiss bank vault where only two people dmitri nabokov and an unknown person had access 
portions of the manuscript were shown to nabokov scholars 
in april NUM dmitri announced that he would publish the novel 
prior to the incomplete novels publication several short excerpts of the original of laura were made public german weekly die zeit reproduced some of nabokovs original index cards obtained by its reporter malte herwig in its NUM august NUM issue 
in the accompanying article herwig concludes that laura although fragmentary is vintage nabokov
in july NUM playboy magazine acquired the rights to print a NUM-word excerpt from the original of laura
it was printed in the december issue 
the original of laura was published on NUM november NUM
nabokovs first writings were in russian but he achieved his greatest fame with the novels he wrote in the english language 
as a bilingual trilingual french everyone forgets mademoiselle o master he has been compared to joseph conrad nabokov however disliked both the comparison and conrads work 
he lamented to the critic edmund wilson i am too old to change conradically  which john updike later called itself a jest of genius
nabokov translated many of his own early works into english sometimes in cooperation with his son dmitri 
his trilingual upbringing had a profound influence on his artistry 
nabokov himself translated into russian two books that he had originally written in english conclusive evidence and lolita
the translation of conclusive evidence was made because of nabokovs feeling of imperfections in the english version 
writing the book he noted that he needed to translate his own memories into english and to spend a lot of time explaining things that are well known in russia then he decided to re-write the book once again in his first native language and after that he made the final version speak memory nabokov first wanted to name it speak mnemosyne
nabokov was a proponent of individualism and rejected concepts and ideologies that curtailed individual freedom and expression such as totalitarianism in its various forms as well as sigmund freuds psychoanalysis 
poshlost or as he transcribed it poshlust is disdained and frequently mocked in his works 
on translating lolita nabokov writes i imagined that in some distant future somebody might produce a russian version of lolita 
i trained my inner telescope upon that particular point in the distant future and i saw that every paragraph pock-marked as it is with pitfalls could lend itself to hideous mistranslation 
in the hands of a harmful drudge the russian version of lolita would be entirely degraded and botched by vulgar paraphrases or blunders 
so i decided to translate it myself 
nabokovs creative processes involved writing sections of text on hundreds of index cards which he expanded into paragraphs and chapters and rearranged to form the structure of his novels a process that has been adopted by many screenplay writers in subsequent years 
nabokov published under the pseudonym vladimir sirin in the NUMs to NUMs occasionally to mask his identity from critics 
he also makes cameo appearances in some of his novels such as the character vivian darkbloom an anagram of vladimir nabokov who appears in both lolita and ada or ardor and the character blavdak vinomori another anagram of nabokovs name in king queen knave 
nabokov is noted for his complex plots clever word play daring metaphors and prose style capable of both parody and intense lyricism 
he gained both fame and notoriety with his novel lolita NUM which tells of a grown mans devouring passion for a twelve-year-old girl 
this and his other novels particularly pale fire NUM won him a place among the greatest novelists of the NUMth century 
his longest novel which met with a mixed response is  NUM
he devoted more time to the composition of this novel than any of his others 
nabokovs fiction is characterized by linguistic playfulness 
for example his short story the vane sisters is famous in part for its acrostic final paragraph in which the first letters of each word spell out a message from beyond the grave 
in another of his short stories signs and symbols NUM nabokov creates a character suffering from an imaginary illness called referential mania in which the afflicted is faced with a world of environmental objects exchanging coded messages 
nabokovs stature as a literary critic is founded largely on his four-volume translation and commentary for alexander pushkins novel in verse eugene onegin published in NUM
that commentary ended with an appendix titled notes on prosody which has developed a reputation of its own 
it stemmed from his observation that while pushkins iambic tetrameters had been a part of russian literature for a fairly short two centuries they were clearly understood by the russian prosodists 
on the other hand he viewed the much older english iambic tetrameters as muddled and poorly documented 
in his own wordsi have been forced to invent a simple little terminology of my own explain its application to english verse forms and indulge in certain rather copious details of classification before even tackling the limited object of these notes to my translation of pushkins eugene onegin an object that boils down to very littlein comparison to the forced preliminariesnamely to a few things that the non-russian student of russian literature must know in regard to russian prosody in general and to eugene onegin in particular 
nabokovs lectures at cornell university as collected in lectures on literature reveal his controversial ideas concerning art 
he firmly believed that novels should not aim to teach and that readers should not merely empathize with characters but that a higher aesthetic enjoyment should be attained partly by paying great attention to details of style and structure 
he detested what he saw as general ideas in novels and so when teaching ulysses for example he would insist students keep an eye on where the characters were in dublin with the aid of a map rather than teaching the complex irish history that many critics see as being essential to an understanding of the novel 
in NUM kitsch magazine a student publication at cornell published a piece that focused on student reflections on his lectures and also explored nabokovs long relationship with playboy
nabokov also wanted his students to describe the details of the novels rather than a narrative of the story and was very strict when it came to grading 
as edward jay epstein described his experience in nabokovs classes that he made it clear from the very first lectures that he had little interest in fraternizing with students who would be known not by their name but by their seat number 
nabokov was a self-described synesthete who at a young age equated the number five with the colour red 
aspects of synesthesia can be found in several of his works 
his wife also exhibited synesthesia like her husband her minds eye associated colours with particular letters 
they discovered that dmitri shared the trait and moreover that the colours he associated with some letters were in some cases blends of his parents hueswhich is as if genes were painting in aquarelle
for some synesthetes letters are not simply associated with certain colors they are themselves colored 
nabokov frequently endowed his protagonists with a similar gift 
in bend sinister krug comments on his perception of the word loyalty as being like a golden fork lying out in the sun 
in the defense nabokov mentioned briefly how the main characters father a writer found he was unable to complete a novel that he planned to write becoming lost in the fabricated storyline by starting with colors
many other subtle references are made in nabokovs writing that can be traced back to his synesthesia 
many of his characters have a distinct sensory appetite reminiscent of synesthesia 
nabokovs interest in entomology had been
inspired by books of maria sibylla merian he had found in the attic of his familys country home in vyra 
throughout an extensive career of collecting he never learned to drive a car and he depended on his wife vra to take him to collecting sites 
during the NUMs as a research fellow in zoology he was responsible for organizing the butterfly collection of the museum of comparative zoology at harvard university 
his writings in this area were highly technical 
this combined with his specialty in the relatively unspectacular tribe polyommatini of the family lycaenidae has left this facet of his life little explored by most admirers of his literary works 
he described the karner blue 
the genus nabokovia was named after him in honor of this work as were a number of butterfly and moth species eg 
many species in the genera madeleinea and pseudolucia bear epithets alluding to nabokov or names from his novels
in NUM nabokov commented the pleasures and rewards of literary inspiration are nothing beside the rapture of discovering a new organ under the microscope or an undescribed species on a mountainside in iran or peru 
it is not improbable that had there been no revolution in russia i would have devoted myself entirely to lepidopterology and never written any novels at all 
the palaeontologist and essayist stephen jay gould discussed nabokovs lepidoptery in his essay no science without fancy no art without facts the lepidoptery of vladimir nabokov reprinted in i have landed
gould notes that nabokov was occasionally a scientific stick-in-the-mud
for example nabokov never accepted that genetics or the counting of chromosomes could be a valid way to distinguish species of insects and relied on the traditional for lepidopterists microscopic comparison of their genitalia 
the harvard museum of natural history which now contains the museum of comparative zoology still possesses nabokovs genitalia cabinet where the author stored his collection of male blue butterfly genitalia 
nabokov was a serious taxonomist says museum staff writer nancy pick author of the rarest of the rare stories behind the treasures at the harvard museum of natural history
he actually did quite a good job at distinguishing species that you would not think were differentby looking at their genitalia under a microscope six hours a day seven days a week until his eyesight was permanently impaired 
the rest of his collection about NUM specimens was given to the lausannes museum of zoology in switzerland 
though his work was not taken seriously by professional lepidopterists during his life new genetic research supports nabokovs hypothesis that a group of butterfly species called the polyommatus blues came to the new world over the bering strait in five waves eventually reaching chile 
many of nabokovs fans have tried to ascribe literary value to his scientific papers gould notes 
conversely others have claimed that his scientific work enriched his literary output 
gould advocates a third view holding that the other two positions are examples of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy 
rather than assuming that either side of nabokovs work caused or stimulated the other gould proposes that both stemmed from nabokovs love of detail contemplation and symmetry 
nabokov spent considerable time during his exile on the composition of chess problems 
such compositions he published in the russian migr press poems and problems NUM chess compositions and speak memory one problem
he describes the process of composing and constructing in his memoir the strain on the mind is formidable the element of time drops out of ones consciousness
to him the originality invention conciseness harmony complexity and splendid insincerity of creating a chess problem was similar to that in any other art 
nabokov was a classical liberal in the tradition of his father a liberal statesman who served in the provisional government following the february revolution of NUM
nabokov was a self-proclaimed white russian and was from its inception a strong opponent of the soviet government that came to power following the bolshevik revolution of october NUM
in a poem he wrote as a teenager in NUM he described lenins bolsheviks as grey rag-tag people
throughout his life nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father and equally opposed tsarist autocracy communism and fascism 
nabokovs father vladimir dmitrievich nabokov was the most outspoken defender of jewish rights in the russian empire continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father dmitry nabokov who as justice minister under tsar alexander ii had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the interior minister 
that family strain would continue in vladimir nabokov who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings and in the NUMs nabokov was able to escape hitlers germany only with the help of russian jewish migrs who still had grateful memories of his familys defense of jews in tsarist times 
when asked in NUM whether he would like to revisit the land he had fled in NUM now the soviet union he replied theres nothing to look at 
new tenement houses and old churches do not interest me 
the hotels there are terrible 
i detest the soviet theater 
any palace in italy is superior to the repainted abodes of the tsars 
the village huts in the forbidden hinterland are as dismally poor as ever and the wretched peasant flogs his wretched cart horse with the same wretched zest 
as to my special northern landscape and the haunts of my childhood  well i would not wish to contaminate their images preserved in my mind 
later during his american period he expressed contempt for student activism and all collective movements 
in both letters and interviews he reveals a profound contempt for the new left movements of the NUMs describing the protestors as conformists and goofy hoodlums
nabokov supported the vietnam war effort and voiced admiration for president richard nixon 
on his religious views nabokov was an agnostic 
despite the fact that nabokovs wife was his biggest supporter and assisted him throughout his entire lifetime nabokov admitted to having a prejudice against women writers 
he wrote to edmund wilson who had been making suggestions for his lectures i dislike jane austen and am prejudiced in fact against all women writers 
they are in another class 
however on rereading austens mansfield park he soon changed his mind and taught it in his literature course he also praised the work of mary mccarthy 
although his wife vra nabokov worked as his personal translator and secretary he made publicly known that his ideal translator was a male and particularly not a russian-born female
in the first chapter of glory he attributes the protagonists similar prejudice to the impressions made by childrens writers like lidiya charski and in the short story the admiralty spire deplores the posturing snobbery antisemitism and cutesiness he considered characteristic of russian women authors 
the russian literary critic yuly aykhenvald was an early admirer of nabokov citing in particular his ability to imbue objects with life he saturates trivial things with life sense and psychology and gives a mind to objects his refined senses notice colorations and nuances smells and sounds and everything acquires an unexpected meaning and truth under his gaze and through his words 
the critic james wood argued that nabokovs use of descriptive detail proved an overpowering and not always very fruitful influence on two or three generations after him including authors such as martin amis and john updike 
while a student at cornell in the NUMs thomas pynchon attended several of nabokovs lectures and alluded to lolita in chapter six of his novel the crying of lot NUM NUM in which serge counter-tenor in the band the paranoids sings

it has also been argued that pynchons prose style is influenced by nabokovs preference for actualism over realism 
of the authors who came to prominence during nabokovs lifetime john banville don delillo salman rushdie and edmund white were all influenced by him 
several authors who came to prominence in the NUMs and NUMs have also cited nabokovs work as a literary influence 
aleksandar hemon whose high-wire wordplay and sense of the absurd are often compared to nabokovs has acknowledged the latters impact on his writing 
pulitzer prize-winning novelist michael chabon listed lolita and pale fire among the books that i thought changed my life when i read them and stated that nabokovs english combines aching lyricism with dispassionate precision in a way that seems to render every human emotion in all its intensity but never with an ounce of schmaltz or soggy language
pulitzer prize winner jeffrey eugenides said that nabokov has always been and remains one of my favorite writers 
hes able to juggle ten balls where most people can juggle three or four 
t coraghessan boyle said that nabokovs playfulness and the ravishing beauty of his prose are ongoing influences on his writing and jhumpa lahiri marisha pessl maxim d shrayer zadie smith and ki longfellow have also acknowledged nabokovs influence 
nabokov is featured both as an individual character and implicitly in w g sebalds NUM novel the emigrants
the song cycle sing poetry on the NUM contemporary classical album troika comprises settings of russian and english versions of three of nabokovs poems by such composers as jay greenberg michael schelle and lev zhurbin 
western canon

the western canon is the body of books music and art that scholars generally accept as the most important and influential in shaping western culture 
it includes works of fiction non-fiction poetry drama music art sculpture and architecture generally perceived as being of major artistic merit and representing the high culture of europe and north america 
university of california philosopher john searle suggests that the western canon can be roughly defined as a certain western intellectual tradition that goes from say socrates to wittgenstein in philosophy and from homer to james joyce in literature
the bible a product of middle eastern culture has been a major force in shaping western culture and has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought literature and art
the canon of books including western literature and western philosophy has been fairly stable although it has expanded to include more women and racial minorities while the canons of music and the visual arts have greatly expanded to cover the middle ages and subsequent centuries once largely overlooked 
also during the twentieth century there has been a growing interest in the cultures of asia africa the middle east and south america 
in particular the former colonies of european countries began in the twentieth century to produce major works both in literature and in the other arts 
this is especially reflected in the nobel prizes awarded in literature 
but some examples of newer media such as cinema have attained a precarious position in the canon 
there has been an ongoing debate over the nature and status of the canon especially in america since at least the NUMs much of which is rooted in critical theory feminism critical race theory and marxism 
in particular postmodern studies have argued that the body of scholarship is biased because the traditional main focus of academic studies of western culture and history has only been on works produced by western men 
a classic is a book or any other work of art accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy for example through an imprimatur such as being listed in a list of great books or through a readers personal opinion 
although the term is often associated with the western canon it can be applied to works of literature music and art etc 
from all traditions such as the chinese classics or the vedas 
a related word is masterpiece or chef duvre which in modern use refers to a creation that has been given much critical praise especially one that is considered the greatest work of a persons career or to a work of outstanding creativity skill or workmanship 
historically the word refers to a work of a very high standard produced in order to obtain membership of a guild or academy 
the first writer to use the term classic was aulus gellius a NUMnd-century roman writer who in the miscellany noctes atticae NUM NUM NUM refers to a writer as a classicus scriptor non proletarius a distinguished not a commonplace writer
such classification began with the greeks ranking their cultural works with the word canon carpenters rule
moreover early christian church fathers used canon to rank the authoritative texts of the new testament preserving them given the expense of vellum and papyrus and mechanical book reproduction thus being comprehended in a canon ensured a books preservation as the best way to retain information about a civilization 
contemporarily the western canon defines the best of western culture 
in the ancient world at the alexandrian library scholars coined the greek term hoi enkrithentes the admitted the included to identify the writers in the canon 
with regard to books what makes a book classic is a concern that has occurred to various authors ranging from italo calvino to mark twain and the related questions of why read the classics
and what is a classic
have been essayed by authors from different genres and eras including calvino t s eliot charles augustin sainte-beuve michael dirda and ezra pound 
the terms classic book and western canon are closely related concepts but they are not necessarily synonymous 
a canon refers to a list of books considered to be essential and is presented in a variety of ways 
it can be published as a collection such as great books of the western world modern library everymans library or penguin classics presented as a list with an academics imprimatur such as harold blooms or be the official reading list of an institution of higher learning 
some of the writers who are generally considered the most important in western literature are homer aeschylus sophocles euripides virgil horace geoffrey chaucer dante alighieri william shakespeare franois rabelais jean racine molire cames miguel de cervantes michel de montaigne john milton samuel johnson johann wolfgang von goethe william wordsworth jane austen stendhal walt whitman gustave flaubert emily dickinson honor de balzac charles dickens herman melville george eliot leo tolstoy henrik ibsen sigmund freud fyodor dostoyevsky ea de queirs marcel proust thomas mann robert musil james joyce virginia woolf franz kafka ts 
eliot william faulkner jorge luis borges pablo neruda fernando pessoa albert camus and samuel beckett 
harold bloom has divided the body of western literature into four ages





a university or college great books program is a program inspired by the great books movement begun in the united states in the NUMs by prof john erskine of columbia university which proposed to improve the higher education system by returning it to the western liberal arts tradition of broad cross-disciplinary learning 
these academics and educators included robert hutchins mortimer adler stringfellow barr scott buchanan jacques barzun and alexander meiklejohn 
the view among them was that the emphasis on narrow specialization in american colleges had harmed the quality of higher education by failing to expose students to the important products of western civilization and thought 
the essential component of such programs is a high degree of engagement with primary texts called the great books 
the curricula of great books programs often follow a canon of texts considered more or less essential to a students education such as platos republic or dantes divine comedy
such programs often focus exclusively on western culture 
their employment of primary texts dictates an interdisciplinary approach as most of the great books do not fall neatly under the prerogative of a single contemporary academic discipline 
great books programs often include designated discussion groups as well as lectures and have small class sizes 
in general students in such programs receive an abnormally high degree of attention from their professors as part of the overall aim of fostering a community of learning 
over NUM institutions of higher learning mostly in the united states offer some version of a great books program as an option for students 
there has been an ongoing debate especially in the us over the nature and status of the canon since at least the NUMs much of which is rooted in critical theory feminism critical race theory and marxism 
in particular postmodern studies have argued that the body of scholarship is biased because the main focus traditionally of the academic studies of history and western culture has only been on europe and men 
american philosopher jay stevenson argues

classicist bernard knox made direct reference to this topic when he delivered his NUM jefferson lecture the us federal governments highest honor for achievement in the humanities
knox used the intentionally provocative title the oldest dead white european males as the title of his lecture and his subsequent book of the same name in both of which knox defended the continuing relevance of classical culture to modern society 
some intellectuals have championed a high conservative modernism that insists that universal truths exist and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths 
many argued that natural law was the repository of timeless truths 
allan bloom in his highly influential the closing of the american mind how higher education has failed democracy and impoverished the souls of todays students NUM argues that moral degradation results from ignorance of the great classics that shaped western culture 
bloom further comments but one thing is certain wherever the great books make up a central part of the curriculum the students are excited and satisfied 
his book was widely cited by some intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by cultural relativists 
yale university professor of humanities and famous literary critic harold bloom no relation has also argued strongly in favor of the canon in his NUM book  and in general the canon remains as a represented idea in many institutions though its implications continue to be debated 
defenders maintain that those who undermine the canon do so out of primarily political interests and that such criticisms are misguided andor disingenuous 
as john searle professor emeritus of philosophy at the university of california berkeley has written
one of the main objections to a canon of literature is the question of authority who should have the power to determine what works are worth reading
searles rebuttal suggests that one obvious difficulty with it ie  arguments against hierarchical ranking of books is that if it were valid it would argue against any set of required readings whatever indeed any list you care to make about anything automatically creates two categories those that are on the list and those that are not 
charles altieri of the university of california berkeley states that canons are an institutional form for exposing people to a range of idealized attitudes 
it is according to this notion that work may be removed from the canon over time to reflect the contextual relevance and thoughts of society 
american historian todd m compton argues that canons are always communal in nature that there are limited canons for say a literature survey class or an english department reading list but there is no such thing as one absolute canon of literature 
instead there are many conflicting canons 
he regards blooms western canon as a personal canon only 
the process of defining the boundaries of the canon is endless 
the philosopher john searle has said in my experience there never was in fact a fixed canon there was rather a certain set of tentative judgments about what had importance and quality 
such judgments are always subject to revision and in fact they were constantly being revised 
one of the notable attempts at compiling an authoritative canon for literature in the english-speaking world was the great books of the western world program 
this program developed in the middle third of the NUMth century grew out of the curriculum at the university of chicago 
university president robert maynard hutchins and his collaborator mortimer adler developed a program that offered reading lists books and organizational strategies for reading clubs to the general public 
an earlier attempt had been made in NUM by harvard university president charles w eliot with the harvard classics a NUM-volume anthology of classic works from world literature 
eliots view was the same as that of scottish philosopher and historian thomas carlyle the true university of these days is a collection of books
the hero as man of letters NUM

the canon of renaissance english poetry of the NUMth and early NUMth century has always been in some form of flux and towards the end of the NUMth century the established canon was criticized especially by those who wished to expand it to include for example more women writers 
however the central figures of the british renaissance canon remain edmund spenser sir philip sidney christopher marlowe william shakespeare ben jonson and john donne 
spenser donne and jonson were major influences on NUMth-century poetry 
however poet john dryden condemned aspects of the metaphysical poets in his criticism 
in the NUMth century metaphysical poetry fell into further disrepute while the interest in elizabethan poetry was rekindled through the scholarship of thomas warton and others 
however the canon of renaissance poetry was formed in the victorian period with anthologies like palgraves golden treasury
in the twentieth century t s eliot and yvor winters were two literary critics who were especially concerned with revising the canon of renaissance english literature 
eliot for example championed poet sir john davies in an article in the times literary supplement in NUM
during the course of the NUMs eliot did much to establish the importance of the metaphysical school both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his own work 
however by NUM a alvarez was commenting that it may perhaps be a little late in the day to be writing about the metaphysicals 
the great vogue for donne passed with the passing of the anglo-american experimental movement in modern poetry 
two decades later a hostile view was expressed that emphasis on their importance had been an attempt by eliot and his followers to impose a high anglican and royalist literary history on NUMth-century english poetry 
the american critic yvor winters suggested in NUM an alternative canon of elizabethan poetry which would exclude the famous representatives of the petrarchan school of poetry represented by sir philip sidney and edmund spenser 
winters claimed that the native or plain style anti-petrarchan movement had been undervalued and argued that george gascoigne NUM deserves to be ranked  among the six or seven greatest lyric poets of the century and perhaps higher
towards the end of the NUMth century the established canon was increasingly under fire 
in the twentieth century there was a general reassessment of the literary canon including womens writing post-colonial literatures gay and lesbian literature writing by people of colour working peoples writing and the cultural productions of historically marginalized groups 
this reassessment has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered literature and genres hitherto not regarded as literary such as childrens writing journals letters travel writing and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest 
the western literary canon has also expanded to include the literature of asia africa the middle east and south america 
writers from countries like turkey china egypt peru and colombia japan etc  have received nobel prizes since the late NUMs 
writers from asia and africa have also been nominated for and also won the booker prize in recent years 
the feminist movement produced both feminist fiction and non-fiction and created new interest in womens writing 
it also prompted a general reevaluation of womens historical and academic contributions in response to the belief that womens lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest 
however in britain and america at least women achieved major literary success from the late eighteenth century and many major nineteenth century british novelists were women including jane austen the bront family elizabeth gaskell and george eliot 
there were also two major female poets elizabeth barrett browning and emily dickinson 
in the twentieth century there were also many major female writers including katherine mansfield dorothy richardson virginia woolf eudora welty and marianne moore 
notable female writers in france include colette and simone de beauvoir and in russia anna akhmatova 
much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women 
virago press began to publish its large list of NUMth and early NUMth century novels in NUM and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation 
in the twentieth century the western literary canon started to include black writers not only from black american writers but also from the wider black diaspora of writers in britain france latin america and africa 
this is largely due to the shift in social and political views during the civil rights movement in the united states 
the first global recognition came in NUM when gwendolyn brooks was the first black american to win a pulitzer prize for literature 
chinua achebes novel things fall apart helped draw attention to african literature 
nigerian wole soyinka was the first african to win the nobel prize in literature in NUM and american toni morrison was the first black woman to win in NUM
throughout american history african americans have been discriminated against and this experience inspired some black writers at least during the early years to prove they were the equals of white american authors 
as henry louis gates jr  has said it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture 
african-american writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the united states 
some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity 
this means that in american society literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination 
by borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the african diaspora african-american literature broke the mystique of connection between literary authority and patriarchal power 
in producing their own literature african americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter 
this view of african-american literature as a tool in the struggle for black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades most famously by w e b 
du bois 
since the NUMs the western literary canon has been expanded to include writers from asia africa the middle east and south america 
this is reflected in the nobel prizes awarded in literature 
yasunari kawabata NUM  NUM was a japanese novelist and short story writer whose spare lyrical subtly-shaded prose works won him the nobel prize for literature in NUM the first japanese author to receive the award 
his works have enjoyed broad international appeal and are still widely read

gabriel garca mrquez NUM  NUM was a colombian novelist short-story writer screenwriter and journalist 
considered one of the most significant authors of the NUMth century and one of the best in the spanish language he was awarded the NUM neustadt international prize for literature and the NUM nobel prize in literature 
garca mrquez started as a journalist and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories but is best known for his novels such as one hundred years of solitude NUM the autumn of the patriarch NUM and love in the time of cholera NUM
his works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations 
some of his works are set in a fictional village called macondo the town mainly inspired by his birthplace aracataca and most of them explore the theme of solitude 
on his death in april NUM juan manuel santos the president of colombia described him as the greatest colombian who ever lived 
mario vargas llosa b 
NUM is a peruvian writer politician journalist essayist college professor and recipient of the NUM nobel prize in literature 
vargas llosa is one of latin americas most significant novelists and essayists and one of the leading writers of his generation 
some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the latin american boom 
upon announcing the NUM nobel prize in literature the swedish academy said it had been given to vargas llosa for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individuals resistance revolt and defeat
the discussion of the literary canon above especially with regard to great book and the debate over the canon is also relevant 
ancient greek philosophy has consistently held a prominent place in the canon 
only a relatively small number of works of greek philosophy have survived essentially those thought most worth copying in the middle ages 
plato aristotle and indirectly socrates are the primary figures 
roman philosophy is included but regarded as less significant as it tended to be even by the romans themselves
the ancient philosophy of other cultures now receives more attention than before the NUMth century 
the vast body of christian philosophy is typically represented on reading lists mainly by saints augustine of hippo and thomas aquinas and the NUMth-century jewish scholar maimonides is now usually represented mostly by the guide for the perplexed
the academic canon of early modern philosophy generally includes descartes spinoza leibniz locke berkeley hume and kant though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period 
women have engaged in philosophy throughout the fields history 
there were female philosophers since ancient times notably hipparchia of maroneia active c NUM bc and arete of cyrene active NUMthNUMth century bc and some were accepted as philosophers during the ancient medieval modern and contemporary eras but almost no female philosophers have entered the philosophical western canon 
in the early NUMs the canadian philosophical association claimed that there is gender imbalance and gender bias in the academic field of philosophy 
in june NUM a us sociology professor stated that out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals female authors comprise just NUM.NUM percent of the total 
while other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics 
many philosophers today agree that greek philosophy has influenced much of western culture since its inception 
alfred north whitehead once noted the safest general characterization of the european philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to plato 
clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient greek and hellenistic philosophers to early islamic philosophy the european renaissance and the age of enlightenment 
some claim that greek philosophy in turn was influenced by the older wisdom literature and mythological cosmogonies of the ancient near east but philosophy as we understand it is a greek creation 
plato was a philosopher in classical greece and the founder of the academy in athens the first institution of higher learning in the western world 
he is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy especially the western tradition unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries 
aristotle was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist 
his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theater music rhetoric linguistics politics and governmentand constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy 
aristotles views on physical science had a profound influence on medieval scholarship 
their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and his views were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics 
in metaphysics aristotelianism profoundly influenced judeo-islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the roman catholic church 
aristotle was well known among medieval muslim intellectuals and revered as the first teacher 
his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics 
all aspects of aristotles philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today 
major western writers and philosophers have been influenced by eastern philosophy 
american modernist poet t s eliot wrote that the great philosophers of india make most of the great european philosophers look like schoolboys
arthur schopenhauer in the preface to his book the world as will and representation writes that one who has also received and assimilated the sacred primitive indian wisdom then he is the best of all prepared to hear what i have to say to him the NUMth century american philosophical movement transcendentalism was also influenced by indian thought 
major philosophers of the renaissance include niccol machiavelli pico della mirandola nicolas of cusa giordano bruno and galileo galilei 
the seventeenth century was important for philosophy and the major figures were francis bacon NUM thomas hobbes NUM ren descartes NUM baruch spinoza NUM john locke NUM gottfried wilhelm leibniz NUM and isaac newton NUM c NUM
major philosophers of the eighteenth century include george berkeley NUM david hume NUM adam smith NUM immanuel kant NUM jeremy bentham NUM voltaire NUM jean-jacques rousseau NUM and edmund burke NUM
important nineteenth century philosophers include georg wilhelm friedrich hegel NUM-NUM sren kierkegaard NUM-NUM karl marx NUM and friedrich nietzsche NUM
major twentieth century figures are henri bergson NUM edmund husserl NUM-NUM bertrand russell NUM-NUM martin heidegger NUM-NUM and ludwig wittgenstein NUM
a porous distinction between analytic and continental approaches emerged during this period 
the term continental is misleading as many prominent british philosophers such as r g collingwood and michael oakeshott were non-analytic and many non-british european philosophers like wittgenstein were analytic 
moreover analytic approaches are dominant in the netherlands scandinavia germany and parts of east-central europe today 
some argue in english-speaking countries it is better to distinguish between the dominant approaches of university departments where modern language departments tend to favor continental methods and philosophy department tends to favor analytic ones 
however the humanitiessocial sciences departments in general such as history sociology anthropology and political science departments in english-speaking countries tend to favor continental methods such as those by michel foucault NUM-NUM pierre bourdieu NUM-NUM and jrgen habermas NUM- 
female philosophers have begun to gain prominence in the last hundred years 
notable female philosophers from the contemporary period include susanne langer NUM simone de beauvoir NUM and martha nussbaum NUM 
the term classical music did not appear until the early NUMth century in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from johann sebastian bach to ludwig van beethoven as a golden age 
in addition to bach and beethoven the other major figures from this period were joseph haydn and wolfgang amadeus mozart 
the earliest reference to classical music recorded by the oxford english dictionary is from about NUM
in classical music during the nineteenth century a canon developed which focused on what was felt to be the most important works written since NUM with a great concentration on the later part of this period termed the classical period which is generally taken to begin around NUM
after beethoven the major nineteenth century composers include robert schumann frdric chopin hector berlioz franz liszt richard wagner johannes brahms anton bruckner giuseppe verdi giacomo puccini and pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky 
in the NUMs the standard concert repertoire of professional orchestras chamber music groups and choirs tends to focus on works by a relatively small number of mainly NUMth and NUMth century male composers 
many of the works deemed to be part of the musical canon are from genres regarded as the most serious such as the symphony concerto string quartet and opera 
folk music was already giving art music melodies and from the late NUMth century in an atmosphere of increasing nationalism folk music began to influence composers in formal and other ways before being admitted to some sort of status in the canon itself 
since the early twentieth century non-western music has begun to influence western composers 
in particular direct homages to javanese gamelan music are found in works for western instruments by claude debussy bla bartk francis poulenc olivier messiaen pierre boulez benjamin britten john cage steve reich and philip glass 
debussy was immensely interested in non-western music and its approaches to composition 
specifically he was drawn to the javanese gamelan which he first heard at the NUM paris exposition 
he was not interested in directly quoting his non-western influences but instead allowed this non-western aesthetic to generally influence his own musical work for example by frequently using quiet unresolved dissonances coupled with the damper pedal to emulate the shimmering effect created by a gamelan ensemble 
american composer philip glass was not only influenced by the eminent french composition teacher nadia boulanger but also by the indian musicians ravi shankar and alla rakha his distinctive style arose from his work with shankar and rakha and their perception of rhythm in indian music as being entirely additive 
in the latter half of the NUMth century the canon expanded to cover the so-called early music of the pre-classical period and baroque music by composers other than bach and george frideric handel 
including antonio vivaldi claudio monteverdi domenico scarlatti alessandro scarlatti henry purcell georg philipp telemann jean-baptiste lully jean-philippe rameau marc-antoine charpentier arcangelo corelli franois couperin heinrich schtz and dieterich buxtehude 
earlier composers such as giovanni pierluigi da palestrina orlande de lassus and william byrd have also received more attention in the last hundred years 
the absence of female composers from the canon has been debated in the twentieth century even though there have been female composers throughout the classical music period 
marcia j citron for example has examined the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women sic composers from the received canon of performed musical works 
more recently the music of hildegard von bingen NUM a german benedictine abbess has been rediscovered and both the russian sofia gubaidulina NUM  and finnish kaija saariaho NUM  have achieved international reputations 
saariahos opera lamour de loin has been staged in some of the worlds major opera houses including the english national opera NUM and in NUM the metropolitan opera in new york 
the backbone of traditional western art history is a celebratory chronology of artworks mostly of a luxury nature commissioned by elite groups in western europe for private or public enjoyment as well as works in drawing and printmaking 
much of this was religious mostly roman catholic art 
the classical art of greece and rome has been regarded since the renaissance as the fount of the western tradition and has been long regarded as superior to modern creations in the equivalent fields in particular sculpture 
giorgio vasari NUM is the great originator of the artistic canon and the originator of many of the concepts it embodies 
his lives of the most excellent painters sculptors and architects covers only artists working in italy with a strong pro-florentine prejudice and has cast a long shadow over succeeding centuries 
northern european art has arguably never quite caught up to italy in terms of prestige and vasaris placing of giotto as the founding father of modern painting has largely been retained 
in painting the rather vague term of old master covers painters up to about the time of goya 
such a canon remains prominent as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks as well as the prices obtained in the art trade 
but there have been considerable swings of fortune in what is valued 
in the NUMth century the baroque fell into great disfavour to be revived from about the NUMs by which time the academic art of the NUMth and NUMth century was largely disregarded and victorian painting generally with its equivalents in other countries 
the high renaissance vasari regarded as the greatest period has always retained its prestige including works by leonardo da vinci michelangelo and raphael but the succeeding period of mannerism has fallen in and out of favour 
in the NUMth century the beginnings of academic art history led by german universities led to much better understanding and appreciation of medieval art and a more nuanced understanding of classical art including the realization that many if not most treasured masterpieces of sculpture were late roman copies rather than greek originals 
the european tradition of art was expanded to include byzantine art and the new discoveries of archaeology notably etruscan art celtic art and upper paleolithic art 
since the NUMth century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of art made by women vernacular creativity especially in printed media and an expansion to include works in the western tradition produced outside europe 
at the same time there has been a much greater appreciation of non-western traditions including their place with western art in wider global or eurasian traditions 
the decorative arts have traditionally had a much lower critical status than fine art although often highly valued by collectors and still tend to be given little prominence in undergraduate studies or popular coverage on television and in print 
women were discriminated against in terms of obtaining the training necessary to be an artist in the mainstream western traditions 
in addition since the renaissance the nude more often than not female has had a special position as subject matter 
in her NUM essay why have there been no great women artists
 linda nochlin analyzes what she sees as the embedded privilege in the predominantly male western art world and argues that womens outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique womens position in art but to additionally examine the disciplines underlying assumptions about gender and ability 
nochlins essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men preventing women with rare exception from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world 
in the NUMs feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history art museums and galleries and questioned which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy 
this position is articulated by artist judy chicago
it is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums 
whereas men experience presence in our art institutions women experience primarily absence except in images that do not necessarily reflect womens own sense of themselves 
english artist and sculptor barbara hepworth dbe NUM NUM whose work exemplifies modernism and in particular modern sculpture is one of the few female artists to achieve international prominence 
in NUM the art of american modernist georgia okeefe has been staged at the tate modern in london and is then moving in december NUM to vienna austria before visiting the art gallery of ontario canada in NUM
the preface to the blackwell anthology of renaissance literature from NUM acknowledges the importance of online access to literary texts on the selection of what to include meaning that the selection can be made on basis of functionality rather than representativity
this anthology has made its selection based on three principles 
one is unabashedly canonical meaning that sidney spenser marlowe shakespeare and jonson have been given the space prospective users would expect 
a second principle is non-canonical giving female writers such as anne askew elizabeth cary emilia lanier martha moulsworth and lady mary wroth a representative selection 
it also includes texts that may not be representative of the qualitatively best efforts of renaissance literature but of the quantitatively most numerous texts such as homilies and erotica 
a third principle has been thematic so that the anthology aims to include texts that shed light on issues of special interest to contemporary scholars 
the blackwell anthology is still firmly organised around authors however 
a different strategy has been observed by the penguin book of renaissance verse from NUM
here the texts are organised according to topic under the headings the public world images of love topographies friends patrons and the good life church state and belief elegy and epitaph translation writer language and public
it is arguable that such an approach is more suitable for the interested reader than for the student 
while the two anthologies are not directly comparable since the blackwell anthology also includes prose and the penguin anthology goes up to NUM it is telling that while the larger blackwell anthology contains work by NUM poets seven of which are women the penguin anthology contains NUM poems by NUM poets including NUM women and one poet each in welsh sin phylip and irish eochaidh  heghusa 
the best german novels of the twentieth century is a list of books compiled in NUM by and bertelsmann in which NUM prominent german authors literary critics and scholars of german ranked the most significant german-language novels of the twentieth century

william faulkner

william cuthbert faulkner  september NUM NUM july NUM NUM was an american writer and nobel prize laureate from oxford mississippi 
faulkner wrote novels short stories a play poetry essays and screenplays 
he is primarily known for his novels and short stories set in the fictional yoknapatawpha county based on lafayette county mississippi where he spent most of his life 
faulkner is one of the most celebrated writers in american literature generally and southern literature specifically 
though his work was published as early as NUM and largely during the NUMs and NUMs faulkner was not widely known until receiving the NUM nobel prize in literature for which he became the only mississippi-born nobel winner 
two of his works a fable NUM and his last novel the reivers NUM won the pulitzer prize for fiction 
in NUM the modern library ranked his NUM novel the sound and the fury sixth on its list of the NUM best english-language novels of the NUMth century also on the list were as i lay dying NUM and light in august NUM
absalom absalom
NUM appears on similar lists 
his first published story a rose for emily is one of the most famous an american has written 
born william cuthbert falkner in new albany mississippi william faulkner was the first of four sons of murry cuthbert falkner august NUM NUM august NUM NUM and maud butler november NUM NUM october NUM NUM
he had three younger brothers murry charles jack falkner june NUM NUM  december NUM NUM author john faulkner september NUM NUM march NUM NUM and dean swift falkner august NUM NUM november NUM NUM
soon after his first birthday his family moved to ripley mississippi where his father murry worked as the treasurer for the family-owned gulf  chicago railroad company 
murry hoped to inherit the railroad from his father john wesley thompson falkner but john had little confidence in murrys ability to run a business and sold it for NUM
following the sale of the railroad business murry proposed a plan to get a new start for his family by moving to texas and becoming a rancher 
maud disagreed with this proposition however and they moved instead to oxford mississippi where murrys father owned several businesses making it easy for murry to find work 
thus four days prior to williams fifth birthday the falkner family settled in oxford where he lived on and off for the rest of his life 
his family particularly his mother maud his maternal grandmother lelia butler and caroline callie barr the black nanny who raised him from infancy crucially influenced the development of faulkners artistic imagination 
both his mother and grandmother were avid readers as well as painters and photographers educating him in visual language 
while murry enjoyed the outdoors and encouraged his sons to hunt track and fish maud valued education and took pleasure in reading and going to church 
she taught her sons to read before sending them to public school and exposed them to classics such as charles dickens and grimms fairy tales 
faulkners lifelong education by callie barr is central to his novels preoccupations with the politics of sexuality and race 
as a schoolchild faulkner had success early on 
he excelled in the first grade skipped the second and did well through the third and fourth grades 
however beginning somewhere in the fourth and fifth grades of his schooling faulkner became a much quieter and more withdrawn child 
he began to play hooky occasionally and became somewhat indifferent to his schoolwork instead taking interest in studying the history of mississippi on his own time beginning in the seventh grade 
the decline of his performance in school continued and faulkner wound up repeating the eleventh and twelfth grade never graduating from high school 
faulkner spent his boyhood listening to stories told to him by his elders including those of the civil war slavery the ku klux klan and the falkner family 
faulkners grandfather would also tell him of the exploits of williams great-grandfather and namesake william clark falkner who was a successful businessman writer and civil war hero 
telling stories about old colonel as his family called him had already become something of a family pastime when faulkner was a boy 
according to one of faulkners biographers by the time william was born his great-grandfather had been enshrined long since as a household deity 
when he was NUM faulkner met philip stone who became an important early influence on his writing 
stone was four years his senior and came from one of oxfords older families he was passionate about literature and had already earned bachelors degrees from yale and the university of mississippi 
faulkner also attended the latter joined the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity and pursued his dream to become a writer 
stone read and was impressed by some of faulkners early poetry becoming one of the first to recognize and encourage faulkners talent 
stone mentored the young faulkner introducing him to the works of writers such as james joyce who influenced faulkners own writing 
in his early NUMs faulkner gave poems and short stories he had written to stone in hopes of their being published 
stone would in turn send these to publishers but they were uniformly rejected 
the younger faulkner was greatly influenced by the history of his family and the region in which he lived 
mississippi marked his sense of humor his sense of the tragic position of black and white americans his characterization of southern characters and his timeless themes including fiercely intelligent people dwelling behind the faades of good ol boys and simpletons 
unable to join the united states army due to his height he was NUM NUM faulkner enlisted in a reservist unit of the british army in toronto 
despite his claims records indicate that faulkner was never actually a member of the british royal flying corps and never saw service during the first world war 
in NUM faulkners surname went from falkner to faulkner 
according to one story a careless typesetter simply made an error 
when the misprint appeared on the title page of his first book faulkner was asked whether he wanted the change 
he supposedly replied either way suits me 
in adolescence faulkner began writing poetry almost exclusively 
he did not write his first novel until NUM
his literary influences are deep and wide 
he once stated that he modeled his early writing on the romantic era in late NUMth- and early NUMth-century england 
he attended the university of mississippi ole miss in oxford enrolling in NUM going three semesters before dropping out in november NUM
william was able to attend classes at the university due to his father having a job there as a business manager 
he skipped classes often and received a d grade in english 
however some of his poems were published in campus publications 
although faulkner is identified with mississippi he was residing in new orleans louisiana in NUM when he wrote his first novel soldiers pay 
after being directly influenced by sherwood anderson he made his first attempt at fiction writing 
anderson assisted in the publication of soldiers pay and mosquitoes faulkners second novel set in new orleans by recommending them to his publisher 
the miniature house at NUM pirates alley just around the corner from st louis cathedral in new orleans is now the site of faulkner house books where it also serves as the headquarters of the pirates alley faulkner society 
during the summer of NUM faulkner wrote his first novel set in his fictional yoknapatawpha county titled flags in the dust 
this novel drew heavily on the traditions and history of the south in which faulkner had been engrossed in his youth 
he was extremely proud of the novel upon its completion and he believed it to be a significant step up from his previous two novels 
however when submitted for publication it was rejected by the publishers boni  liveright 
faulkner was devastated by this rejection but he eventually allowed his literary agent ben wasson to significantly edit the text and the novel was published in NUM as sartoris 
the original version was issued as flags in the dust in NUM.
in the autumn of NUM just after his NUMst birthday he began working on the sound and the fury
he started by writing three short stories about a group of children with the last name compson but soon began to feel that the characters he had created might be better suited for a full-length novel 
perhaps as a result of disappointment in the initial rejection of flags in the dust faulkner had now become indifferent to his publishers and wrote this novel in a much more experimental style 
in describing the writing process for this work faulkner would later say one day i seemed to shut the door between me and all publishers addresses and book lists 
i said to myself now i can write 
after its completion faulkner insisted that ben wasson not do any editing or add any punctuation for clarity 
in NUM faulkner married estelle oldham andrew kuhn serving as best man at the wedding 
estelle brought with her two children from her previous marriage to cornell franklin and faulkner hoped to support his new family as a writer 
he began writing as i lay dying in NUM while working night shifts at the university of mississippi power house 
the novel would be published in NUM
beginning in NUM faulkner sent out some of his short stories to various national magazines 
several of his stories were published which brought him enough income to buy a house in oxford for his family to inhabit which he named rowan oak 
he made money on his NUM novel sanctuary which was widely reviewed and read but widely disliked for its perceived criticism of the south
by NUM faulkner was in need of money 
he asked wasson to sell the serialization rights for his newly completed novel light in august to a magazine for NUM but none accepted the offer 
then mgm studios offered faulkner work as a screenwriter in hollywood 
although not an avid moviegoer he needed the money and so accepted the job offer and arrived in culver city california in may NUM
there he worked with director howard hawks with whom he quickly developed a friendship as they both enjoyed drinking and hunting 
howard hawks brother william hawks became faulkners hollywood agent 
faulkner would continue to find reliable work as a screenwriter from the NUMs to the NUMs 
faulkner served as writer-in-residence at the university of virginia at charlottesville from february to june NUM and again in NUM
as a teenager in oxford faulkner dated estelle oldham NUM the popular daughter of major lemuel and lida oldham and believed he would some day marry her 
however estelle dated other boys during their romance and in NUM one of them cornell franklin proposed marriage to her before faulkner did 
estelles parents insisted she marry cornell as he was an ole miss law graduate had recently been commissioned as a major in the hawaiian territorial forces and came from a respectable family with which they were old friends 
estelles marriage to franklin fell apart ten years later and they divorced in april NUM
two months later faulkner and estelle wed in june NUM at college hill presbyterian church just outside oxford mississippi 
they honeymooned on the mississippi gulf coast at pascagoula then returned to oxford first living with relatives while they searched for a home of their own to purchase 
in NUM faulkner purchased the antebellum home rowan oak known at that time as the shegog place from irish planter robert shegog 
after his death estelle and their daughter jill lived at rowan oak until estelles death in NUM
the property was sold to the university of mississippi that same year 
the house and furnishings are maintained much as they were in faulkners day

NUM
faulkner was also a prolific writer of short stories 
his first short story collection these NUM NUM includes many of his most acclaimed and most frequently anthologized stories including a rose for emily red leaves that evening sun and dry september
faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in yoknapatawpha county based on and nearly geographically identical to lafayette county of which his hometown of oxford mississippi is the county seat 
yoknapatawpha was faulkners postage stamp and the bulk of work that it represents is widely considered by critics to amount to one of the most monumental fictional creations in the history of literature 
three of his novels the hamlet the town and the mansion known collectively as the snopes trilogy document the town of jefferson and its environs as an extended family headed by flem snopes insinuates itself into the lives and psyches of the general populace 
his short story a rose for emily was his first story published in a major magazine the forum but received little attention from the public 
after revisions and reissues it gained popularity and is now considered one of his best 
faulkner was known for his experimental style with meticulous attention to diction and cadence 
in contrast to the minimalist understatement of his contemporary ernest hemingway faulkner made frequent use of stream of consciousness in his writing and wrote often highly emotional subtle cerebral complex and sometimes gothic or grotesque stories of a wide variety of characters including former slaves or descendants of slaves poor white agrarian or working-class southerners and southern aristocrats 
in an interview with the paris review in NUM faulkner remarked let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if he is interested in technique 
there is no mechanical way to get the writing done no shortcut 
the young writer would be a fool to follow a theory 
teach yourself by your own mistakes people learn only by error 
the good artist believes that nobody is good enough to give him advice 
he has supreme vanity 
no matter how much he admires the old writer he wants to beat him 
another esteemed southern writer flannery oconnor stated that the presence alone of faulkner in our midst makes a great difference in what the writer can and cannot permit himself to do 
nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the dixie limited is roaring down
faulkner wrote two volumes of poetry which were published in small printings the marble faun NUM and a green bough NUM and a collection of mystery stories knights gambit NUM
faulkners work has been examined by many critics from a wide variety of critical perspectives 
the new critics became very interested in faulkners work with cleanth brooks writing the yoknapatawpha country and michael millgate writing the achievement of william faulkner
since then critics have looked at faulkners work using other approaches such as feminist and psychoanalytic methods 
faulkners works have been placed within the literary traditions of modernism and the southern renaissance 
according to critic and translator valerie miles faulkners influence on latin american fiction is considerable with fictional worlds created by gabriel garca mrquez macondo and juan carlos onetti santa maria being very much in the vein of yoknapatawpha  carlos fuentes the death of artemio cruz wouldnt exist if not for as i lay dying
the works of william faulkner are a clear influence on the french novelist claude simon 
faulkner was awarded the NUM nobel prize for literature for his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the modern american novel

faulkner detested the fame and glory that resulted from his recognition 
his aversion was so great that his NUM-year-old daughter learned of the nobel prize only when she was called to the principals office during the school day 
he donated part of his nobel money to establish a fund to support and encourage new fiction writers eventually resulting in the penfaulkner award for fiction and donated another part to a local oxford bank establishing a scholarship fund to help educate african-american teachers at rust college in nearby holly springs mississippi 
the government of france made faulkner a chevalier de la lgion dhonneur in NUM
faulkner was awarded two pulitzer prizes for what are considered minor novels his NUM novel a fable which took the pulitzer in NUM and the NUM novel the reivers which was posthumously awarded the pulitzer in NUM
the award for a fable was a controversial political choice 
the jury had selected milton lotts the last hunt for the prize but pulitzer prize administrator professor john hohenberg convinced the pulitzer board that faulkner was long overdue for the award despite a fable being a lesser work of his and the board overrode the jurys selection much to the disgust of its members 
he also won the us national book award twice for collected stories in NUM and a fable in NUM
in NUM he was one of three finalists for the first ellery queen mystery magazine award and placed second to rhea galati 
the united states postal service issued a NUM-cent postage stamp in his honor on august NUM NUM

as long as i live under the capitalistic system i expect to have my life influenced by the demands of moneyed people

the grapes of wrath

the grapes of wrath is an american realist novel written by john steinbeck and published in NUM
the book won the national book award
and pulitzer prize for fiction and it was cited prominently when steinbeck was awarded the nobel prize in NUM
set during the great depression the novel focuses on the joads a poor family of tenant farmers driven from their oklahoma home by drought economic hardship agricultural industry changes and bank foreclosures forcing tenant farmers out of work 
due to their nearly hopeless situation and in part because they are trapped in the dust bowl the joads set out for california 
along with thousands of other okies they seek jobs land dignity and a future 
the grapes of wrath is frequently read in american high school and college literature classes due to its historical context and enduring legacy 
a celebrated hollywood film version starring henry fonda and directed by john ford was released in NUM
the narrative begins just after tom joad is paroled from mcalester prison where he had been imprisoned after being convicted of homicide 
on his return to his home near sallisaw oklahoma tom meets former preacher jim casy whom he remembers from his childhood and the two travel together 
when they arrive at toms childhood farm home they find it deserted 
disconcerted and confused tom and casy meet their old neighbor muley graves who tells them the family has gone to stay at uncle john joads home nearby 
graves tells them that the banks have evicted all the farmers but he refuses to leave the area 
the next morning tom and casy go to uncle johns 
tom finds his family loading their remaining possessions into a hudson motor car company sedan converted to a truck with their crops destroyed by the dust bowl the family has defaulted on their bank loans and their farm has been repossessed 
consequently the joads see no option but to seek work in california described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay 
the joads put everything they have into making the journey 
although leaving oklahoma would violate his parole tom decides it is worth the risk and invites casy to join him and his family 
traveling west on route NUM the joad family find the road crowded with other migrants 
in makeshift camps they hear many stories from others some returning from california and the group worries about lessening prospects 
the family dwindles as well grandpa dies along the road and they bury him in a field grandma dies close to the california state line and both noah the eldest joad son and connie rivers the husband of the pregnant joad daughter rose of sharon leave the family 
led by ma the remaining members realize they can only continue as nothing is left for them in oklahoma 
reaching california they find the state oversupplied with labor wages are low and workers are exploited to the point of starvation 
the big corporate farmers are in collusion and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices 
weedpatch camp one of the clean utility-supplied camps operated by the resettlement administration a new deal agency offers better conditions but does not have enough resources to care for all the needy families 
nonetheless as a federal facility the camp protects the migrants from harassment by california deputies 
in response to the exploitation casy becomes a labor organizer and tries to recruit for a labor union 
the remaining joads work as strikebreakers in a peach orchard where casy is involved in a strike that eventually turns violent 
when tom joad witnesses casys fatal beating he kills the attacker and flees as a fugitive 
the joads later leave the orchard for a cotton farm where tom is at risk of being arrested for the homicide 
tom bids his mother farewell and promises to work for the oppressed 
rose of sharons baby is stillborn 
ma joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement 
with rain the joads dwelling is flooded and they move to higher ground 
in the final chapter of the book the family takes shelter from the flood in an old barn 
inside they find a young boy and his father who is dying of starvation 
rose of sharon takes pity on the man and offers him her breast milk to save him from starvation 
many scholars note steinbeck for his many uses of christian imagery within the grapes of wrath 
the largest implications lie with tom joad and jim casy who are both interpreted as christ-like figures at certain intervals within the novel 
these two are often interpreted together with jim casy representing jesus christ in the early days of his ministry up until his death which is interpreted as representing the death of christ 
from there tom takes over rising in casys place as the christ figure risen from the dead 
however the religious imagery is not limited to these two characters 
scholars have regularly inspected other characters and plot points within the novel including ma joad rose of sharon rose of sharons stillborn child and uncle john 
in an article first published in NUM ken eckert even compared the migrants movement west as a reversed version of the slaves escape from egypt in exodus 
many of these extreme interpretations are brought on by steinbecks own documented beliefs which eckert himself refers to as unorthodox 
steinbeck was known to have borrowed from field notes taken during NUM by farm security administration worker and author sanora babb 
while babb collected personal stories about the lives of the displaced migrants for a novel she was developing her supervisor tom collins shared her reports with steinbeck then working at the san francisco news
babbs own novel whose names are unknown was eclipsed in NUM by the success of the grapes of wrath and was shelved until it was finally published in NUM a year before babbs death 
the grapes of wrath developed from the harvest gypsies a series of seven articles that ran in the san francisco news from october NUM to NUM NUM
the newspaper commissioned that work on migrant workers from the midwest in californias agriculture industry 
it was later compiled and published separately 
while writing the novel at his home NUM greenwood lane in what is now monte sereno california steinbeck had unusual difficulty devising a title 
the grapes of wrath suggested by his wife carol steinbeck was deemed more suitable than anything by the author 
the title is a reference to lyrics from the battle hymn of the republic by julia ward howe emphasis added

these lyrics refer in turn to the biblical passage revelation NUM an apocalyptic appeal to divine justice and deliverance from oppression in the final judgment 
this and other biblical passages had inspired a long tradition of imagery of christ in the winepress in various media 
the passage reads

the phrase also appears at the end of chapter NUM in steinbecks book which describes the purposeful destruction of food to keep the price high

the image invoked by the title serves as a crucial symbol in the development of both the plot and the novels greater thematic concerns from the terrible winepress of dust bowl oppression will come terrible wrath but also the deliverance of workers through their cooperation 
this is suggested but not realized within the novel 
when preparing to write the novel steinbeck wrote i want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this the great depression and its effects.
he famously said ive done my damnedest to rip a readers nerves to rags 
this work won a large following among the working class due to steinbecks sympathy for the migrants and workers movement and his accessible prose style 
steinbeck scholar john timmerman sums up the books influence the grapes of wrath may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel  in criticism reviews and college classrooms  of NUMth century american literature

according to the new york times it was the best-selling book of NUM and NUM copies had been printed by february NUM

soon it won the pulitzer prize for fiction 
the book was noted for steinbecks passionate depiction of the plight of the poor and many of his contemporaries attacked his social and political views 
bryan cordyack writes steinbeck was attacked as a propagandist and a socialist from both the left and the right of the political spectrum 
the most fervent of these attacks came from the associated farmers of california they were displeased with the books depiction of california farmers attitudes and conduct toward the migrants 
they denounced the book as a pack of lies and labeled it communist propaganda
some accused steinbeck of exaggerating camp conditions to make a political point 
steinbeck had visited the camps well before publication of the novel and argued their inhumane nature destroyed the settlers spirit 
in NUM the nobel prize committee cited grapes of wrath as a great work and as one of the committees main reasons for granting steinbeck the nobel prize for literature 
in NUM time magazine included the novel in its time NUM best english-language novels from NUM to NUM

the book was quickly made into a famed NUM hollywood movie of the same name directed by john ford and starring henry fonda as tom joad

ellison applied twice for admission to tuskegee institute the prestigious all-black university in alabama founded by booker t washington 
he was finally admitted in NUM for lack of a trumpet player in its orchestra 
ellison hopped freight trains to get to alabama and was soon to find out that the institution was no less class-conscious than white institutions generally were 
ellisons outsider position at tuskegee sharpened his satirical lens critic hilton als believes standing apart from the universitys air of sanctimonious negritude enabled him to write about it 
in passages of invisible man he looks back with scorn and despair on the snivelling ethos that ruled at tuskegee 
tuskegees music department was perhaps the most renowned department at the school headed by composer william l dawson

wright was then openly associated with the communist party and ellison was publishing and editing for communist publications although his affiliation was quieter according to historian carol polsgrove in divided minds
both wright and ellison lost their faith in the communist party during world war ii when they felt the party had betrayed african americans and replaced marxist class politics with social reformism

some black communists denounced wright as a bourgeois intellectual but he was largely autodidactic 
he had been forced to end his public education after completing junior high school to support his mother and brother 
wright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents and he had a working relationship with a black nationalist communist these factors led to a public falling out with the party and leading members 
wright later described this episode through his fictional character buddy nealson an african-american communist in his book black boy 
the relations with the party turned violent wright was threatened at knife point by fellow-traveler co-workers denounced as a trotskyite in the street by strikers and physically assaulted by former comrades when he tried to join them during the NUM may day march

wright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled uncle toms children NUM
he based some stories on lynching in the deep south 
the publication and favorable reception of uncle toms children improved wrights status with the communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability 
he was appointed to the editorial board of new masses 
granville hicks a prominent literary critic and communist sympathizer introduced him at leftist teas in boston 
by may NUM NUM excellent sales had provided wright with enough money to move to harlem where he began writing the novel native son which he published in NUM

after wright returned to paris he met twice with an officer from the us state department 
the officers report includes what wright had learned from nkrumah adviser george padmore about nkrumahs plans for the gold coast after independence

according to wright biographer addison gayle a few months later wright talked to officials at the american embassy in paris about people he had met in the communist party at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the us under the smith act 
historian carol polsgrove explored why wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the civil rights movement during the NUMs in the united states 
she found that wright was under what his friend chester himes called extraordinary pressure to avoid writing about the us

despite that in march wright outlined a novel in which his character fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating

the peaceful parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers 
on june NUM NUM after a party marking the french publication of white man listen wright became ill 
he suffered a virulent attack of amoebic dysentery probably contracted during his NUM stay on the gold coast 
by november NUM his wife had found a london apartment but wrights illness and four hassles in twelve days with british immigration officials ended his desire to live in england 
on february NUM NUM wright learned from his agent reynolds that the new york premiere of the stage adaptation of the long dream received such bad reviews that the adapter ketti frings had decided to cancel further performances 
meanwhile wright was running into added problems trying to get the long dream published in france 
these setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of island of hallucinations for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from doubleday and sons 
in june NUM wright recorded a series of discussions for french radio dealing primarily with his books and literary career 
he also addressed the racial situation in the united states and the world and specifically denounced american policy in africa 
in late september to cover extra expenses for his daughter julias move from london to paris to attend the sorbonne wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for nicole barclay director of the largest record company in paris 
in spite of his financial straits wright refused to compromise his principles

still interested in literature wright helped kyle onstott get his novel mandingo NUM published in france 
wrights last display of explosive energy occurred on november NUM NUM in his polemical lecture the situation of the black artist and intellectual in the united states delivered to students and members of the american church in paris

black boy became an instant best-seller upon its publication in NUM
wrights stories published during the NUMs disappointed some critics who said that his move to europe had alienated him from african americans and separated him from his emotional and psychological roots 
many of wrights works failed to satisfy the rigid standards of new criticism during a period when the works of younger black writers gained in popularity 
during the NUMs wright grew more internationalist in outlook 
while he accomplished much as an important public literary and political figure with a worldwide reputation his creative work did decline 
while interest in black boy ebbed during the NUMs this has remained one of his best selling books 
since the late NUMth century critics have had a resurgence of interest in it 
black boy remains a vital work of historical sociological and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black mans search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of african-american writers who followed such as james baldwin and ralph ellison 
it is generally agreed that wrights influence in native son is not a matter of literary style or technique 
rather he affected ideas and attitudes and his work has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the united states in the last half of the NUMth century 
wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle said writer amiri baraka 
during the NUMs and NUMs scholars published critical essays about wright in prestigious journals 
richard wright conferences were held on university campuses from mississippi to new jersey 
a new film version of native son with a screenplay by richard wesley was released in december NUM
certain wright novels became required reading in a number of american high schools universities and colleges 
recent critics have called for a reassessment of wrights later work in view of his philosophical project 
notably paul gilroy has argued that the depth of his philosophical interests has been either overlooked or misconceived by the almost exclusively literary enquiries that have dominated analysis of his writing.
his most significant contribution however was his desire to accurately portray blacks to white readers thereby destroying the white myth of the patient humorous subservient black man 
wright was featured in a NUM-minute documentary about the wpa writers project entitled soul of a people writing americas story NUM
his life and work during the NUMs is highlighted in the companion book soul of a people the wpa writers project uncovers depression america

random house had been uncertain about the project but it got good reviews 
alvin beam reviewed it for the cleveland plain dealer writing editors like novelists have brain childrenbooks they think up and bring to life without putting their own names on the title page 
mrs morrison has one of these in the stores now and magazines and newsletters in the publishing trade are ecstatic saying it will go like hotcakes 
morrison had begun writing fiction as part of an informal group of poets and writers at howard university who met to discuss their work

garner had escaped slavery but was pursued by slave hunters 
facing a return to slavery garner killed her two-year-old daughter but was captured before she could kill herself 
morrisons novel imagines the dead baby returning as a ghost beloved to haunt her mother and family 
beloved was a critical success and a best-seller for NUM weeks 
new york times book reviewer michiko kakutani wrote that the scene of the mother killing her baby is nowikiso brutal and disturbing that it appears to warp time before and after into a single unwavering line of fate 
nowiki canadian writer margaret atwood wrote in a review for the new york times ms morrisons versatility and technical and emotional range appear to know no bounds 
if there were any doubts about her stature as a pre-eminent american novelist of her own or any other generation beloved will put them to rest 
not all critics praised beloved however 
african-american conservative social critic stanley crouch for instance complained in his review in the new republic that the novel reads largely like a melodrama lashed to the structural conceits of the miniseries and that morrison perpetually interrupts her narrative with maudlin ideological commercials
despite overall high acclaim beloved failed to win the prestigious national book award or the national book critics circle award

she was the first black woman of any nationality to win the prize 
in her nobel acceptance speech morrison talked about the power of storytelling 
to make her point she told a story 
she spoke about a blind old black woman who is approached by a group of young people 
they demand of her is there no context for our lives
no song no literature no poem full of vitamins no history connected to experience that you can pass along to help us start strong
think of our lives and tell us your particularized world 
make up a story 
for her exceptional writing career in NUM the national endowment for the humanities selected morrison for the jefferson lecture the us federal governments highest honor for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities 
morrisons lecture entitled the future of time literature and diminished expectations began with the aphorism time it seems has no future

morrison was also honored with the NUM national book foundations medal of distinguished contribution to american letters which is awarded to a writer who has enriched our literary heritage over a life of service or a corpus of work 
the third of her beloved trilogy paradise about citizens of an all-black town came out in NUM
the next year morrison was on the cover of time magazine only the second female and second black writer of fiction to appear on what was perhaps the most significant us magazine cover of the era 
also in NUM the movie adaptation of beloved was released directed by jonathan demme and co-produced by oprah winfrey who had spent ten years bringing it to the screen 
winfrey also stars as the main character sethe alongside danny glover as sethes lover paul d and thandie newton as beloved 
the movie flopped at the box office 
a review in the economist suggested that most audiences are not eager to endure nearly three hours of a cerebral film with an original storyline featuring supernatural themes murder rape and slavery 
film critic janet maslin however in her review no peace from a brutal legacy called it a transfixing deeply felt adaptation of toni morrisons novel 
its linchpin is of course oprah winfrey who had the clout and foresight to bring beloved to the screen and has the dramatic presence to hold it together 
in NUM television talk-show host oprah winfrey had selected song of solomon for her newly launched book club which became a popular feature on her oprah winfrey show
an average of NUM million viewers watched the shows book club segments 
as a result when winfrey selected morrisons earliest novel the bluest eye in NUM it sold another NUM paperback copies 
john young wrote in the african american review in NUM that morrisons career experienced the boost of the oprah effect enabling morrison to reach a broad popular audience 
winfrey selected a total of four of morrisons novels over six years giving morrisons novels a bigger sales boost than they got from her nobel prize win in NUM
the novelist also appeared three times on winfreys show 
winfrey said for all those who asked the question toni morrison again
i say with certainty there would have been no oprahs book club if this woman had not chosen to share her love of words with the world

in NUM the new york times book review named beloved the best work of american fiction published in the previous NUM years as chosen by a selection of prominent writers literary critics and editors 
in his essay about the choice in search of the best critic a o scott said any other outcome would have been startling since morrisons novel has inserted itself into the american canon more completely than any of its potential rivals 
with remarkable speed beloved has less than NUM years after its publication become a staple of the college literary curriculum which is to say a classic 
this triumph is commensurate with its ambition since it was morrisons intention in writing it precisely to expand the range of classic american literature to enter as a living black woman the company of dead white males like faulkner melville hawthorne and twain 
in november NUM morrison visited the louvre museum in paris as the second in its grand invit program to guest-curate a month-long series of events across the arts on the theme of the foreigners home 
a mercy came out in NUM
morrison set this novel in the virginia colonies of NUM
diane johnson in her review in vanity fair called a mercy a poetic visionary mesmerizing tale that captures in the cradle of our present problems and strains the natal curse put on us back then by the indian tribes africans dutch portuguese and english competing to get their footing in the new world against a hostile landscape and the essentially tragic nature of human experience 
from NUM until her retirement in NUM morrison held the robert f goheen chair in the humanities at princeton university 
she has said she doesnt think much of modern fiction writers who reference their own lives instead of inventing new material and she used to tell her creative writing students i dont want to hear about your little life ok
similarly she has chosen not to write about her own life in a memoir or autobiography 
though based in the creative writing program at princeton morrison did not regularly offer writing workshops to students after the late NUMs a fact that earned her some criticism 
rather she conceived and developed the prestigious princeton atelier a program that brings together talented students with critically acclaimed world-famous writers and performing artists 
together the students and the artists produce works of art that are presented to the public after a semester of collaboration 
in her position at princeton morrison used her insights to encourage not merely new and emerging writers but artists working to develop new forms of art through interdisciplinary play and cooperation

if hes the great american novelist give me the marx brothers every time

native son

native son NUM is a novel written by the american author richard wright 
it tells the story of NUM-year-old bigger thomas an african american youth living in utter poverty in a poor area on chicagos south side in the NUMs 
while not apologizing for biggers crimes wright portrays a systemic inevitability behind them 
biggers lawyer boris max makes the case that there is no escape from this destiny for his client or any other black american since they are the necessary product of the society that formed them and told them since birth who exactly they were supposed to be 
no american negro exists james baldwin once wrote who does not have his private bigger thomas living in his skull 
frantz fanon discusses the feeling in his NUM essay lexprience vcue du noir the fact of blackness
in the end writes fanon bigger thomas acts 
to put an end to his tension he acts he responds to the worlds anticipation 
the book was a successful and groundbreaking best seller 
however it was also criticized by baldwin and others as ultimately advancing bigger as a stereotype not a real character 
bigger thomas awakens in a dark small room to the sound of the alarm clock 
he lives in one room with his brother buddy his sister vera and their mother 
suddenly a rat appears 
the room turns into a maelstrom and after a violent chase bigger claims the life of the animal with an iron skillet and terrorizes vera with the dead rodent 
vera faints and mrs thomas scolds bigger who hates his family because they suffer and he cannot do anything about it 
that evening bigger has to see mr dalton for a new job 
biggers family depends on him 
he would like to leave his responsibilities forever but when he thinks of what to do he only sees a blank wall 
bigger walks to the poolroom and meets his friend gus 
bigger tells him that every time he thinks about whites he feels something terrible will happen to him 
they meet other friends gh 
and jack and plan a robbery of the white wealth 
they are all afraid of attacking and stealing from a white man but none of them wants to admit his concerns 
before the robbery bigger and jack go to the movies 
they are attracted to the world of wealthy whites in the newsreel and feel strangely moved by the tom-toms and the primitive black people in the film but they also feel they are equal to those worlds 
after the film bigger returns to the poolroom and attacks gus violently forcing him to lick his blade in a demeaning way to hide biggers own cowardice 
the fight ends any chance of the robberys occurring and bigger is obscurely conscious that he has done this intentionally 
when he finally gets the job bigger does not know how to behave in daltons large and luxurious house 
mr dalton and his blind wife use strange words 
they try to be kind to bigger but they actually make him very uncomfortable bigger does not know what they expect of him 
then their daughter mary enters the room asks bigger why he does not belong to a union and calls her father a capitalist
bigger does not know that word and is even more confused and afraid to lose the job 
after the conversation peggy an irish cook takes bigger to his room and tells him the daltons are a nice family but he must avoid marys communist friends 
bigger has never had a room for himself before 
that night he drives mary around and meets her communist boyfriend jan 
throughout the evening jan and mary talk to bigger oblige him to take them to the diner where his friends are invite him to sit at their table and tell him to call them by their first names 
bigger does not know how to respond to their requests and becomes very frustrated as he is simply their chauffeur for the night 
at the diner they buy a bottle of rum 
bigger drives throughout washington park and jan and mary drink the rum and make out in the back seat 
jan and mary part but mary is so drunk that bigger has to carry her to her bedroom when they arrive home 
he is terrified someone will see him with her in his arms however he cannot resist the temptation of the forbidden and he kisses her 
just then the bedroom door opens and mrs dalton enters 
bigger knows she is blind but is terrified she will sense him there 
he silences mary by pressing a pillow into her face 
mary claws at biggers hands while mrs dalton is in the room trying to alert bigger that she cannot breathe 
mrs dalton approaches the bed smells alcohol in the air scolds her daughter and leaves 
as bigger removes the pillow he realizes that mary has suffocated 
bigger starts thinking frantically and decides he will tell everyone that jan her communist boyfriend took mary into the house that night 
thinking it will be better if mary disappears and everyone thinks she has left chicago he decides in desperation to burn her body in the houses furnace 
her body would not originally fit through the furnace opening but after decapitating it bigger finally manages to put the corpse inside 
he adds extra coal to the furnace leaves the corpse to burn and goes home 
biggers current girlfriend bessie suspects him of having done something to mary 
bigger goes back to work 
mr dalton has called a private detective mr britten 
britten interrogates bigger accusingly but dalton vouches for bigger 
bigger relates the events of the previous evening in a way calculated to throw suspicion on jan knowing mr dalton dislikes jan because jan is a communist 
when britten finds jan he puts the boy and bigger in the same room and confronts them with their conflicting stories 
jan is surprised by biggers story but offers him help 
bigger storms away from the daltons
he decides to write a false kidnapping note when he discovers mr dalton owns the rat-infested flat biggers family rents 
bigger slips the note under the daltons front door and then returns to his room 
when the daltons receive the note they contact the police who take over the investigation from britten and journalists soon arrive at the house 
bigger is afraid but he does not want to leave 
in the afternoon he is ordered to take the ashes out of the furnace and make a new fire 
he is terrified and starts poking the ashes with the shovel until the whole room is full of smoke 
furious one of the journalists takes the shovel and pushes bigger aside 
he immediately finds the remains of marys bones and an earring in the furnace and bigger flees 
bigger goes directly to bessie and tells her the whole story 
bessie realizes that white people will think he raped the girl before killing her 
they leave together but bigger has to drag bessie around because she is paralyzed by fear 
when they lie down together in an abandoned building bigger rapes bessie and falls asleep 
in the morning he decides he has to kill her in her sleep 
he hits bessie on the head with a brick before throwing her through a window and into an air shaft 
he quickly realizes that the only money he had was in her pocket 
bigger runs through the city 
he sees newspaper headlines concerning the crime and overhears different conversations about it 
whites hate him and blacks hate him because he brought shame on the black race 
after a wild chase over the rooftops of the city the police catch him 
during his first few days in prison bigger does not eat drink or talk to anyone 
then jan comes to visit him 
he says bigger has taught him a lot about black-white relationships and offers him the help of a communist lawyer named boris max 
in the long hours max and bigger spend talking bigger starts understanding his relationships with his family and with the world 
he acknowledges his fury his need for a future and his wish for a meaningful life 
he reconsiders his attitudes about white people whether they are aggressive like britten or accepting like jan 
bigger is found guilty in front of the court and sentenced to death for murder 
however at the end of the novel he appears to come to terms with his fate 
bigger thomas the protagonist of the novel bigger commits two ghastly crimes and is put on trial for his life 
he is convicted and sentenced to the electric chair 
his acts give the novel action but the real plot involves biggers reactions to his environment and his crime 
through it all bigger struggles to discuss his feelings but he can neither find the words to fully express himself nor does he have the time to say them 
however as they have been related through the narration biggertypical of the outsider archetypehas finally discovered the only important and real thing his life 
though too late his realization that he is aliveand able to choose to befriend mr maxcreates some hope that men like him might be reached earlier 
debatable as the final scene is in which for the first time bigger calls a white man by his first name bigger is never anything but a failed human 
he represents a black man conscious of a system of racial oppression that leaves him no opportunity to exist but through crime 
as he says to gus they dont let us do nothing .. and i cant get used to it 
a line goes one cannot exist by simply reacting a man must be more than the sum total of his brutalizations 
bigger admits to wanting to be an aviator and later to max aspire to other positions esteemed in the american dream 
but here he can do nothing  


just be one of many blacks in what was called the ghetto and maybe get a job serving whites crime seems preferable rather accidental or inevitable 
not surprisingly then he already has a criminal history and he has even been to reform school 
ultimately the snap decisions which law calls crimes arose from assaults to his dignity and being trapped like the rat he killed with a pan living a life where others held the skillet 
mary dalton an only child mary is a very rich white girl who has far leftist leanings 
she is a communist sympathizer recently understood to be frolicking with jan a known communist party organizer 
consequently she is trying to abide for a time by her parents wishes and go to detroit 
she is to leave the morning after bigger is hired as the family chauffeur 
under the ruse of a university meeting she has bigger take her to meet jan 
when they return to the house she is too drunk to make it to her room unassisted and thus bigger helps her 
mrs dalton comes upon them in the room and bigger smothers her for fear that mrs dalton will discover him 
although she dies earlier in the story she remains a significant plot element as bigger constantly has flashbacks during stressful times in which he sees various scenes from her murder 
henry dalton father of mary he owns a controlling amount of stock in a real estate firm which maintains the black ghetto 
blacks in the ghetto pay too much for rat-infested flats 
as max points out at the inquest mr dalton refuses to rent flats to black people outside of the designated ghetto area 
he does this while donating money to the naacp buying ping-pong tables for the local black youth outreach program and giving people like bigger a chance at employment 
mr daltons philanthropy however only shows off his wealth while backing up the business practices which contain an already oppressed people 
an example of this is when the reader learns that mr dalton owns the real estate company that controls a lot of the south side where most of the black community lives but instead of using his power to improve their situation he does things such as donate ping pong tables to them or hire individual blacks to work in his house 
mr dalton is blind to the real plight of blacks in the ghetto a plight that he maintains 
mrs dalton mary daltons mother 
her blindness serves to accentuate the motif of racial blindness throughout the story 
both bigger and max comment on how people are blind to the reality of race in america 
mrs dalton betrays her metaphorical blindness when she meets mrs thomas 
mrs dalton hides behind her philanthropy and claims there is nothing she can do for bigger 
jan erlone jan is a member of the communist party as well as the boyfriend of the very rich mary dalton 
bigger attempts to frame him for the murder of mary 
even though bigger attempts to frame him jan uses this to try to prove that black people arent masters of their own destinies but rather a product of an oppressive white society 
jan had already been seeking for a way to understand the negro so as to organize them along communist lines against the rich like mr dalton 
he is not able to fully do so but he is able to put aside his personal trauma and persuade max to help bigger 
he represents the idealistic young marxist who hopes to save the world through revolution 
however before he can do that he must understand the negro much more than he thinks he does 
gus gus is a member of biggers gang but he has an uneasy relationship with bigger 
both are aware of the others nervous anxiety concerning whites 
consequently bigger would rather brutalize gus than admit he is scared to rob a white man 
jack harding jack is a member of biggers gang and perhaps the only one bigger ever views as a real friend 
gh 
 gh 
is another member of biggers gang 
he is the neutral member of the gang who will do what the gang does but will not be too closely attached to any one member of the gang 
mr boris max a lawyer from the communist party who represents bigger against the states prosecuting attorney 
as a jewish american he is in a position to understand bigger 
it is through his speech during the trial that wright reveals the greater moral and political implications of bigger thomas life 
even though mr max is the only one who understands bigger bigger still horrifies him by displaying just how damaged white society has made him 
when mr max finally leaves bigger he is aghast at the extent of the brutality of racism in america 
the third part of the novel called fate seems to focus on maxs relationship with bigger and because of this max becomes the main character of fate 
bessie mears she is biggers girlfriend 
she drinks often saying she is trying to forget her hard life 
at the end of book NUM bigger takes her to an abandoned building and while there rapes her then proceeds to kill her in haste to keep her from talking to the police 
this is his second murder in the book 
peggy peggy is the daltons irish-american housekeeper and like max can empathize with biggers status as an outsider
however she is more typical of poor whites who are sure to invest in racism if only to keep someone  anyone below themselves 
peggy hides her dislike for blacks and treats bigger nicely 
buddy thomas buddy biggers younger brother idolizes bigger as a male role model 
he defends him to the rest of the family and consistently asks if he can help bigger 
mrs thomas biggers mother 
she struggles to keep her family alive on the meager wages earned by taking in other peoples laundry 
she is a religious woman who believes she will be rewarded in an afterlife but as a black woman accepts that nothing can be done to improve her peoples situation 
additionally she knows bigger will end up hanging from the gallows for his crime but this is just another fact of life 
vera thomas vera is biggers sister 
in her bigger sees many similarities to his mother 
bigger fears vera will grow up to either be like his mother constantly exhausted with the strain of supporting a family or like bessie a drunk trying to escape her troubles 
buckley the state prosecutor 
britten the daltons investigator 
he seems quite prejudiced first towards bigger because bigger is black and then towards jan because jan is a communist
wright based aspects of the novel on the NUM arrest and trial of robert nixon executed in NUM following a series of brick bat murders in los angeles and chicago 
native son was the original title of chicago writer nelson algrens first novel somebody in boots based on a piece of doggerel about the first texan 
algren and wright had met at chicagos john reed club circa NUM and later worked together at the federal writers project in chicago 
according to bettina drews NUM biography nelson algren
a life on the wild side he bequeathed the title native son to wright 
wrights protest novel was an immediate best-seller it sold NUM hardcover copies within three weeks of its publication by the book-of-the-month club on march NUM NUM
it was one of the earliest successful attempts to explain the racial divide in america in terms of the social conditions imposed on african americans by the dominant white society 
it also made wright the wealthiest black writer of his time and established him as a spokesperson for african-american issues and the father of black american literature 
as irving howe said in his NUM essay black boys and native sons the day native son appeared american culture was changed forever 
no matter how much qualifying the book might later need it made impossible a repetition of the old lies  .. and brought out into the open as no one ever had before the hatred fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture 
the novels treatment of bigger and his motivations is an example of literary naturalism 
the book also received criticism from some of wrights fellow african-american writers 
james baldwins NUM essay everybodys protest novel dismissed native son as protest fiction and so limited in its understanding of human character and its artistic value 
the essay was collected with nine others in baldwins notes of a native son NUM
in NUM native son was for the first time published in its entirety by the library of america together with an introduction a chronology and notes by arnold rampersad a well-regarded scholar of african american literary works 
this edition also contains richard wrights NUM essay how bigger was born
the original edition had a masturbation scene removed at the request of the book-of-the-month club 
the novel has endured a series of challenges in public high schools and libraries all over the united states 
many of these challenges focus on the books being sexually graphic unnecessarily violent and profane 
despite complaints from parents many schools have successfully fought to keep wrights work in the classroom 
some teachers believe the themes in native son and other challenged books foster dialogue and discussion in the classroom and guide students into the reality of the complex adult and social world
native son is number NUM on radcliffes rival NUM best novels list
the book is number NUM on the american library associations list of the NUM most frequently challenged books of NUM-NUM
the modern library placed it number NUM on its list of the NUM best novels of the NUMth century 
time magazine also included the novel in its time NUM best english-language novels from NUM to NUM
biblical allusions appear frequently throughout native son but they do not serve as an uplifting component of bigger thomas life 
instead richard wright seems to allude to the bible with irony 
bigger is exposed to christianity through his religious mother reverend hammond a catholic priest and his encounter with the church 
however biggers constant rejection of christianity and the church reveals wrights negative tone toward the religion 
he views christianity as an opiate of the black masses 
bigger has several negative encounters with religion 
in one instance bigger sees his mother singing a hymn when he sneaks into his flat to get his pistol to prepare for robbing blums delicatessen 
his mother is singing the words lord i want to be a christian in my heart in my heart 
her hymns and prayers are wholly ineffective and do nothing to forestall his violence 
even toward the end of the novel facing a possible death sentence biggers mother pleads with her son to pray to god for repentance 
reverend hammond also preaches to bigger yet he does not understand the words of reverend hammond and does not pray for repentance 
instead bigger does the opposite and rejects christianity 
when he later sees the fiery cross that the ku klux klan displays he tears off the cross from his neck which reverend hammond had given him and throws it to the ground 
in yet another instance bigger overhears the church choir singing and ponders whether he should become christian 
however his realization of changing his heart into a humble heart causes him to reject the idea because it meant losing his hope of living in the world 
and he would never do that 
wright directly alludes to the bible in the epigraph of native son
the epigraph states even today is my complaint rebellious my stroke is heavier than my groaning job NUM
this quotation is from the book of job 
according to the bible job was a faithful man of god 
however job experienced immense suffering in his lifetime losing his children and his great wealth 
he was stricken with poverty and boils 
in these afflictions god was silent leaving job in a state of deep spiritual anguish 
this tone of anguish and despair is established in the epigraph at the outset of native son and emphasizes biggers suffering 
job and bigger are parallel characters in their dealings with suffering 
that further suggests the aptness of wrights epigraph 
job suffered trials from an outside force that he could not control 
similar to job bigger struggled with an outside force of the racial norms of society 
the parallel is further strengthened by the freedom both characters display in their defiance 
savory has mentioned two quotes in the book of job and native son that suggest bigger and jobs parallel stories 
the protagonist of the book of job lifts himself proudly through his suffering 
if the charges my opponent brings against me were written down so that i could have them i would wear them proudly around my neck and hold them up for everyone to see 
i would tell god everything i have done and hold my head high in his presence
during this point of the passage job has yet to confess his sins to god 
convinced of his innocence job asserts that he will stand proud and tall in gods presence 
bigger has a similar experience 
he muses he had done this 
he had brought all this about 
in all of his life these two murders were the most meaningful things that had ever happened to him 
he was living truly and deeply no matter what others might think looking at him with their blind eyes 
never had he had the chance to live out the consequences of his actions never had his will been so free as in this night and day of fear and murder and flight
it is the first time in the novel where bigger does not throw the blame on others but instead asserts that he was responsible for his actions 
through that he finally experiences free will and finds freedom 
native son contains several allusions to other works that were significant during wrights time 
one of the major works that influenced native son was harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin NUM the best-selling novel of the NUMth century which also played a major role in the abolitionist movement 
wrights native son NUM contains multiple similarities to uncle toms cabin
like uncle toms cabin native son can be interpreted as an illustration of the harsh reality of racial injustice in the united states 
james baldwin writing in the partisan review boldly linked the two novels 
in both books racial injustice is a pre-ordained pattern set upon the living reality
there is little the characters can do to escape racial discrimination 
additionally both of these novels are a form of social protest seek to disprove the idea that society neatly analyzes and treats race and portray african americans who emerge confused dishonest and panicked as they are trapped and immobilized as prisoners within the american dream 
the title and content of another book wright published the collection of short stories uncle toms children NUM suggest the inspiration stowes work provided wright in his own books 
both uncle toms cabin and uncle toms children exploit the term uncle tom attacking an african american who seems to act in a subservient manner toward white people 
however while these two titles are similar and contain similar themes wrights native son can also be considered reactionary against uncle toms cabin
bigger thomas is the antithesis of uncle tom 
bigger is fearful of and angry toward white society 
he also lacks the religious background and christian faith that uncle tom possessed 
this contrast between the characters of bigger thomas and uncle tom may be wrights attempt to show the contemporary racial conflicts that persisted long after the publication of stowes novel in NUM
wright was affiliated with the communist party of the united states both prior to and following his publishing of native son
the communist ideas in native son are evident as wright draws a parallel between the scottsboro boys case and bigger thomas case 
one parallel is the court scene in native son in which max calls the hate and impatience of the mob congregated upon the streets beyond the window wright p NUM and the mob who surrounded the scottsboro jail with rope and kerosene after the scottsboro boys initial conviction 
maxwell page NUM critics attacked maxs final speech in the courtroom claiming that it was an irrelevant elaboration on wrights own communist beliefs and unrelated to biggers case 
there are many different interpretations concerning which group was the intended target of maxs speech 
james baldwin a renowned critic of wrights presented his own interpretation of maxs final speech in notes by a native son baldwin says maxs speech is addressed to those among us of good will and it seems to say that though there are whites and blacks among us who hate each other we will not there are those who are betrayed by greed by guilt by blood by blood lust but not we we will set our faces against them and join hands and walk together into that dazzling future when there will be no white or black baldwin p NUM
however other critics such as siegel have argued that the original text in native son does not imply the dazzling future when there will be no white or black
thus the argument that maxs final speech is a communist promotion is not supported by the texts in the novel kinnamon NUM
max referred to bigger as a part of the working class in his closing statement 
furthermore in NUM wright also advocated the image of african americans as members of the working class in his article in the new york amsterdam news i have found in the negro worker the real symbol of the working class in america 
foley NUM thus wrights depiction of and belief in the figure of african american workers and his depiction of bigger thomas as a worker showed evidence of communist influence on native son
native son is mentioned in a flashback in the film american history x NUM when dennis criticizes his son dereks teacher for including lessons on african-american literature and affirmative action 
an allusion to the story is presented in part NUM of the second renaissance NUM a short anime film from the animatrix collection 
in this film a domestic robot named bNUM-NUMer is placed on trial for murder 
the name is created using leet speak 
in the motion picture the help NUM the main character played by emma stone is seen in an oblique camera angle to have a copy of native son on her bookshelf 
james baldwins short story previous condition mentions a lead part in a play production of native son as type-casting
in cecil browns novel the life and loves of mr jiveass nigger NUM the protagonist george washington states that he is not fearful that he is not a bigger thomas
native son is mentioned in edward bunkers novel little boy blue NUM as being read while in solitary confinement by the main character alex hammond who is said to be greatly fascinated by it 
a large section of percival everetts novel erasure NUM contains a parody of native son entitled my pafology
a line from the trial speech by bigger thomas lawyer boris max is woven into the plot of lemony snickets book the penultimate peril NUM richard wright an american novelist of the realist school asks a famous unfathomable question .. who knows when some slight shock he asks disturbing the delicate balance between social order and thirsty aspiration shall send the skyscrapers in our cities toppling
.
so when mr wright asks his question he might be wondering if a small event such as a stone dropping into a pond can cause ripples in the system of the world and tremble the things that people want until all this rippling and trembling brings down something enormous ..

in ron suskinds book a hope in the unseen NUM native son is referenced during a discussion the main character takes part in at brown university 
bigger thomas is mentioned in one of the lyrical hooks of the ritual in saul williams the inevitable rise and liberation of niggytardust
NUM
the uNUM song vertigo was called native son by the band during the recording sessions for how to dismantle an atomic bomb NUM
the song was later released in the collections unreleased  rare NUM and uNUM medium rare  remastered NUM
on the hbo series brave new voices during the NUM finals the chicago team performed a poem called lost count a love story
this poem addresses the youth on youth murder in chicago and includes the phrase being brown in bigger thomas town
in the  episode far beyond the stars NUM benny russell cites native son as an example of a significant work of african-american literature 
native son was adapted for the stage by wright and paul green with some conflict between the authors affecting the project 
the initial production directed by orson welles and with canada lee as bigger opened at the st james theatre on march NUM NUM
the book was newly adapted and directed again by kent gash in conjunction with the paul green foundation for intiman theatre in seattle washington in NUM
the production featuring ato essandoh as bigger thomas was a more literal translation of the book than the NUM version and was a critical success 
in NUM a stage adaptation by nambi e kelley played the court theatre in chicago with jerod haynes starring as bigger thomas 
directed by seret scott the show was the highest grossing straight play in the theatres NUM year history went on to win multiple awards and has had celebrated productions across the country most notably at yale repertory theatre in new haven connecticut 
the play can be purchased through samuel french publications 
native son has been filmed twice once in NUM and again in NUM
the first version was made in argentina 
wright aged NUM played the protagonist despite being twice the age of NUM-year-old bigger thomas 
the film was not well received wrights performance was a particular target of critics 
critical reception remains mixed given disparities in the perception of bigger thomas is he a helpless victim of his environment
a symbol of the proletariat empowered by violence
is the incompleteness of biggers personality a realistic portrayal or an act of bad faith that succumbs to racist caricature
audiences were also split along the divide of race and gender they were forced to choose between sympathizing with a rapist or condemn him and ignore that he was a victim of systemic racism 
said ayana mathis of the new york times i dont imagine many black people would have embraced such a grotesque portrait of themselves 
what future what vision is reflected in such a miserable and incompletely realized creature
the play originally a novel was intended to educate its audience about the black experience in the ghetto 
thus its intended audience was and remains white people 
baldwin called it a pamphlet in literary disguise exaggerating characters with the sole purpose of carrying his message 
he went on to say that wright failed because of his insistence that it is  categorization alone which is real and which cannot be transcended 
wright exaggerated his characters with the intention of gaining the sympathies of white people but many of his audiences felt that it perpetuated stereotypes of african americans with little to no benefits 
one of the few successes noted was that the controversial struggling big thomas was a strong attack on white people who wanted to be comforted by complacent black characters onstage 
a farewell to arms

a farewell to arms is a novel by ernest hemingway set during the italian campaign of world war i 
first published in NUM it is a first-person account of an american frederic henry serving as a lieutenant tenente in the ambulance corps of the italian army 
the title is taken from a poem by the NUMth-century english dramatist george peele 
the novel set against the backdrop of world war i describes a love affair between the expatriate henry and an english nurse catherine barkley 
its publication ensured hemingways place as a modern american writer of considerable stature 
the book became his first best-seller and has been called the premier american war novel from that debacle world war i 
the novel has been adapted a number of times initially for the stage in NUM as a film in NUM and again in NUM and as a three-part television miniseries in NUM
the NUM film in love and war directed by richard attenborough and starring chris odonnell and sandra bullock depicts hemingways life in italy as an ambulance driver in the events prior to his writing of a farewell to arms
the novel is divided into five sections 
in the first frederic henry an american paramedic serving in the italian army is introduced to catherine barkley an english nurse by his good friend and roommate rinaldi a surgeon 
frederic attempts to seduce her although he doesnt want a serious relationship his feelings for catherine build 
frederic is wounded in the knee by a mortar on the italian front and sent to a hospital in milan where catherine is also sent 
the second section shows the growth of frederic and catherines relationship as they spend time together in milan over the summer 
frederic and catherine gradually fall in love 
after his knee heals frederic is diagnosed with jaundice but is soon kicked out of the hospital and sent back to the front after it is discovered he concealed alcohol 
by the time he is sent back catherine is three months pregnant 
in the third section frederic returns to his unit and discovers morale has severely dropped 
not long afterwards the austro-hungarians break through the italian lines in the battle of caporetto and the italians retreat 
due to a slow and chaotic retreat frederic and his men go off trail and quickly get lost and a frustrated frederic kills a sergeant for insubordination 
after catching up to the main retreat frederic is taken to a place by the battle police where officers are being interrogated and executed for the treachery that supposedly led to the italian defeat 
however after seeing and hearing that everyone interrogated has been killed frederic escapes by jumping into a river 
he heads to milan to find catherine only to discover that she has been sent to stresa 
in the fourth section catherine and frederic reunite and spend some time in stresa before frederic learns he will soon be arrested 
he and catherine then flee to neutral switzerland in a rowboat given to him by a barkeep 
after interrogation by swiss authorities they are allowed to stay in switzerland 
in the final section frederic and catherine live a quiet life in the mountains until she goes into labor 
after a long and painful birth their son is stillborn 
catherine begins to hemorrhage and soon dies leaving frederic to return to their hotel in the rain 
the novel was based on hemingways own experiences serving in the italian campaigns during the first world war 
the inspiration for catherine barkley was agnes von kurowsky a nurse who cared for hemingway in a hospital in milan after he had been wounded 
he had planned to marry her but she spurned his love when he returned to america 
kitty cannell a paris-based fashion correspondent became helen ferguson 
the unnamed priest was based on don giuseppe bianchi the priest of the NUMth and NUMth regiments of the brigata ancona 
although the sources for rinaldi are unknown the character had already appeared in in our time
michael reynolds however writes that hemingway was not involved in the battles described 
because his previous novel the sun also rises had been written as a roman  clef readers assumed a farewell to arms to be autobiographical 
a farewell to arms was begun during his time at willis m spears guest ranch in wyomings bighorns 
some pieces of the novel were written in piggott arkansas at the home of his then wife pauline pfeiffer and in mission hills kansas while she was awaiting delivery of their baby 
pauline underwent a caesarean section as hemingway was writing the scene about catherine barkleys childbirth 
the novel was first serialized in scribners magazine in the may NUM to october NUM issues 
the book was published in september NUM with a first edition print-run of approximately NUM copies 
the success of a farewell to arms made hemingway financially independent 
the hemingway library edition was released in july NUM with a dust jacket facsimile of the first edition 
the newly published edition presents an appendix with the many alternate endings hemingway wrote for the novel in addition to pieces from early draft manuscripts 
the jfk library hemingway collection has two handwritten pages with possible titles for the book 
most of the titles come from the oxford book of english verse
one of the possible titles hemingway considered was in another country and besides
this comes from the jew of malta by christopher marlowe 
the poem portrait of a lady by t s eliot also starts off by quoting this marlowe work thou hast committed fornication but that was in another country and besides the wench is dead 
hemingways library included both works by eliot and marlowe 
there are at least two copies of the first edition in which hemingway re-inserted the censored text by hand so as to provide a corrected text 
one of these copies was presented to maurice coindreau the other to james joyce 
hemingways corrected text has not been incorporated into modern published editions of the novel however there are some audiobook versions that are uncensored 
also the novel could not be published in italy until NUM because the fascist regime considered it detrimental to the honor of the armed forces both in its description of the battle of caporetto and for a certain anti-militarism implied in the work 
more than one biographer suggests that at the base of the censorship of the fascist regime in the novel there had also been a personal antipathy between the writer and benito mussolini 
hemingway had interviewed him in NUM shortly after he seized power and in his article in the toronto star he poured scorn on mussolini calling him the biggest bluff in europe 
but apart from the official reactions it is known that mussolini did not like the article at all hemingway described mussolini as trying to impress the media by pretending to be deeply absorbed in reading while in reality holding a french-english dictionaryheld upside down 
the italian translation had in fact already been prepared illegally in NUM by fernanda pivano leading to her arrest in turin 
a farewell to arms was met with favorable criticism and is considered one of hemingways best literary works 
gore vidal wrote of the text ... a work of ambition in which can be seen the beginning of the careful artful immaculate idiocy of tone that since has marked  .. hemingways prose 
the last line of the NUM new york times review reads it is a moving and beautiful book 
however since publication a farewell to arms has also been the target of various controversy 
upon its staggered publication - which was due to the medium of its release - through scribers magazine it was banned from boston newsstands due to accusations of a pornographic nature despite hemingways deliberate exclusion of any graphic descriptions of sex preferring instead using omission as a literary device 
the novel was first adapted for the stage by laurence stallings in NUM then as a film in NUM with a NUM remake 
a three-part television miniseries was made in NUM
history of the united states

the history of the united states began with the settlement of indigenous people before NUM bc 
numerous cultures formed 
the arrival of christopher columbus in NUM started the european colonization of the americas 
most colonies formed after NUM
by the NUMs thirteen british colonies contained NUM.NUM million people along the atlantic coast east of the appalachian mountains 
after defeating france the british government imposed a series of new taxes after NUM rejecting the colonists argument that new taxes needed their approval see stamp act NUM
tax resistance especially the boston tea party NUM led to punitive laws by parliament designed to end self-government in massachusetts 
armed conflict began in NUM
in NUM the second continental congress declared a new independent nation the united states of america 
led by general george washington it won the revolutionary war with large support from france 
the peace treaty of NUM gave the new nation the land east of the mississippi river except canada and florida
the articles of confederation established a central government but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer 
a convention in NUM wrote a new constitution that was adopted in NUM
in NUM a bill of rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights 
with washington as the first president and alexander hamilton his chief adviser a strong central government was created 
purchase of the louisiana territory from france in NUM doubled the size of the united states 
a second and final war with britain was fought in NUM which solidified national pride 
encouraged by the notion of manifest destiny us territory expanded all the way to the pacific coast 
while the united states was large in terms of area its population in NUM was only NUM million 
however this grew rapidly reaching NUM.NUM million in NUM NUM million in NUM NUM million in NUM NUM million in NUM and NUM million in NUM
economic growth in terms of overall gdp was even greater 
however compared to european powers the nations military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before NUM
the expansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for yeoman farmers and slave owners 
the expansion of slavery was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles which were resolved by compromises 
slavery was abolished in all states north of the masondixon line by NUM but the south continued to profit off of the institution mostly from production of cotton 
republican abraham lincoln was elected in NUM on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery 
seven southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the confederacy 
its attack of fort sumter against the union forces started the civil war NUM
confederate defeat led to the impoverishment of the south and the abolition of slavery 
in the reconstruction era NUM legal and voting rights were extended to freed slaves 
the national government emerged much stronger and because of the fourteenth amendment in NUM it gained the explicit duty to protect individual rights 
however when white democrats regained their power in the south in NUM often by paramilitary suppression of voting they passed jim crow laws to maintain white supremacy and new disfranchising constitutions that prevented most african americans and many poor whites from voting 
this continued until gains of the civil rights movement in the NUMs and passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights were made 
the united states became the worlds leading industrial power at the turn of the NUMth century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the northeast and midwest and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers and farmers from europe 
the national railroad network was completed and large-scale mining and factories industrialized the northeast and midwest 
mass dissatisfaction with corruption inefficiency and traditional politics stimulated the progressive movement from the NUMs to NUMs which led to many reforms including the NUMth to NUMth constitutional amendments which brought the federal income tax direct election of senators prohibition and womens suffrage 
initially neutral during world war i the united states declared war on germany in NUM and funded the allied victory the following year 
after a prosperous decade in the NUMs the wall street crash of NUM marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide great depression 
democratic president franklin d roosevelt ended the republican dominance of the white house and implemented his new deal programs which included relief for the unemployed support for farmers social security and a minimum wage 
the new deal defined modern american liberalism 
after the japanese attack on pearl harbor in NUM the united states entered world war ii and financed the allied war effort and helped defeat nazi germany in the european theater 
its involvement culminated in using newly invented nuclear weapons on two japanese cities to defeat imperial japan in the pacific theater 
the united states and the soviet union emerged as rival superpowers in the aftermath of world war ii 
during the cold war the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the arms race the space race proxy wars and propaganda campaigns 
the purpose of this was to stop the spread of communism 
in the NUMs in large part due to the strength of the civil rights movement another wave of social reforms was enacted by enforcing the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to african-americans and other racial minorities 
the cold war ended when the soviet union was officially dissolved in NUM leaving the united states as the worlds only superpower 
after the cold war the united states began focusing on modern conflicts in the middle east and nuclear programs in north korea 
the beginning of the NUMst century saw the september NUM attacks by al-qaeda in NUM which was later followed by the us -led wars in iraq and afghanistan 
in NUM the united states had its worst economic crisis since the great depression which was followed by slower-than-usual rates of economic growth during the NUMs 
it is not definitively known how or when the native americans first settled the americas and the present-day united states 
the prevailing theory proposes that people migrated from eurasia across beringia a land bridge that connected siberia to present-day alaska during the ice age and then spread southward throughout the americas 
this migration may have begun as early as NUM years ago and continued through to about NUM years ago when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the ending of the last glacial period 
these early inhabitants called paleoamericans soon diversified into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes 
the pre-columbian era incorporates all period subdivisions in the history and prehistory of the americas before the appearance of significant european influences on the american continents spanning the time of the original settlement in the upper paleolithic period to european colonization during the early modern period 
while technically referring to the era before christopher columbus voyages of NUM to NUM in practice the term usually includes the history of american indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly influenced by europeans even if this happened decades or even centuries after columbus initial landing 
native american cultures are not normally included in characterizations of advanced stone age cultures as neolithic which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in eurasia africa and other regions 
the archaeological periods used are the classifications of archaeological periods and cultures established in gordon willey and philip phillips NUMbook method and theory in american archaeology
they divided the archaeological record in the americas into five phases see archaeology of the americas 
the clovis culture a megafauna hunting culture is primarily identified by use of fluted spear points 
artifacts from this culture were first excavated in NUM near clovis new mexico 
the clovis culture ranged over much of north america and also appeared in south america 
the culture is identified by the distinctive clovis point a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute by which it was inserted into a shaft 
dating of clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of carbon dating methods 
recent reexaminations of clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of NUM and NUM radiocarbon years bp 
roughly NUM to NUMbce
numerous paleoindian cultures occupied north america with some arrayed around the great plains and great lakes of the modern united states of america and canada as well as adjacent areas to the west and southwest 
according to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the americas they have been living on this continent since their genesis described by a wide range of traditional creation stories 
other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river believed to be the mississippi river 
genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast asians 
archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the americas 
the folsom tradition was characterized by use of folsom points as projectile tips and activities known from kill sites where slaughter and butchering of bison took place 
folsom tools were left behind between NUMbce and NUMbce 
na-den-speaking peoples entered north america starting around NUM bce reaching the pacific northwest by NUM bce and from there migrating along the pacific coast and into the interior 
linguists anthropologists and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into north america later than the first paleo-indians 
they migrated into alaska and northern canada south along the pacific coast into the interior of canada and south to the great plains and the american southwest 
they were the earliest ancestors of the athabascan- speaking peoples including the present-day and historical navajo and apache 
they constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages which were used seasonally 
people did not live there year-round but for the summer to hunt and fish and to gather food supplies for the winter 
the oshara tradition people lived from NUM bce to NUM ce 
they were part of the southwestern archaic tradition centered in north-central new mexico the san juan basin the rio grande valley southern colorado and southeastern utah 
since the NUMs archeologists have explored and dated eleven middle archaic sites in present-day louisiana and florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple earthwork mounds they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of neolithic revolution to sustain such large villages over long periods 
the prime example is watson brake in northern louisiana whose NUM-mound complex is dated to NUMbce making it the oldest dated site in the americas for such complex construction 
it is nearly NUMyears older than the poverty point site 
construction of the mounds went on for NUMyears until was abandoned about NUM bce probably due to changing environmental conditions 
poverty point culture is a late archaic archaeological culture that inhabited the area of the lower mississippi valley and surrounding gulf coast 
the culture thrived from NUMbce to NUMbce during the late archaic period 
evidence of this culture has been found at more than NUMsites from the major complex at poverty point a unesco world heritage site across a range to the jaketown site near belzoni mississippi 
poverty point is a complex of six major earthwork concentric rings with additional platform mounds at the site 
artifacts show the people traded with other native americans located from georgia to the great lakes region 
this is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the mississippi and ohio valleys 
they were one of several succeeding cultures often referred to as mound builders 
the woodland period of north american pre-columbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly NUMbce to NUMce in the eastern part of north america 
the term woodland was coined in the NUMs and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the archaic period and the mississippian cultures 
the hopewell tradition is the term for the common aspects of the native american culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern united states from NUM bce to NUM ce 
the indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast were of many nations and tribal affiliations each with distinctive cultural and political identities but they shared certain beliefs traditions and practices such as the centrality of salmon as a resource and spiritual symbol 
their gift-giving feast potlatch is a highly complex event where people gather in order to commemorate special events 
these events such as the raising of a totem pole or the appointment or election of a new chief 
the most famous artistic feature of the culture is the totem pole with carvings of animals and other characters to commemorate cultural beliefs legends and notable events 
the hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society but a widely dispersed set of related populations who were connected by a common network of trade routes known as the hopewell exchange system 
at its greatest extent the hopewell exchange system ran from the southeastern united states into the southeastern canadian shores of lake ontario 
within this area societies participated in a high degree of exchange most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes 
the hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the united states 
native development in hawaii begins with the settlement of polynesians between NUMst century to NUMth century 
around NUM ad tahitian explorers found and began settling the area as well 
this became the rise of the hawaiian civilization and would be separated from the rest of the world for another NUM years until the arrival of the british 
europeans under the british explorer captain james cook arrived in the hawaiian islands in NUM
within five years of contact european military technology would help kamehameha i conquer most of the people and eventually unify the islands for the first time establishing the kingdom of hawaii 
after a period of exploration sponsored by major european nations the first successful english settlement was established in NUM
europeans brought horses cattle and hogs to the americas and in turn took back to europe maize turkeys potatoes tobacco beans and squash 
many explorers and early settlers died after being exposed to new diseases in the americas 
the effects of new eurasian diseases carried by the colonists especially smallpox and measles were much worse for the native americans as they had no immunity to them 
they suffered epidemics and died in very large numbers usually before large-scale european settlement began 
their societies were disrupted and hollowed out by the scale of deaths 
spanish explorers were the first europeans with christopher columbus second expedition to reach puerto rico on november NUM NUM others reached florida in NUM
spanish expeditions quickly reached the appalachian mountains the mississippi river the grand canyon and the great plains 
in NUM hernando de soto undertook an extensive exploration of the southeast 
in NUM francisco vsquez de coronado explored from arizona to central kansas 
small spanish settlements eventually grew to become important cities such as san antonio texas albuquerque new mexico tucson arizona los angeles california and san francisco california 
new netherland was a NUMth-century dutch colony centered on present-day new york city and the hudson river valley the dutch traded furs with the native americans to the north 
the colony served as a barrier to expansion from new england 
despite being calvinists and building the reformed church in america the dutch were tolerant of other religions and cultures 
the colony which was taken over by britain in NUM left an enduring legacy on american cultural and political life 
this includes secular broad-mindedness and mercantile pragmatism in the city as well as rural traditionalism in the countryside typified by the story of rip van winkle
notable americans of dutch descent include martin van buren theodore roosevelt franklin d roosevelt eleanor roosevelt and the frelinghuysens 
new france was the area colonized by france from NUM to NUM
there were few permanent settlers outside quebec and acadia but the french had far-reaching trading relationships with native americans throughout the great lakes and midwest 
french villages along the mississippi and illinois rivers were based in farming communities that served as a granary for gulf coast settlements 
the french established plantations in louisiana along with settling new orleans mobile and biloxi 
the wabanaki confederacy were military allies of new france through the four french and indian wars while the british colonies were allied with the iroquois confederacy 
during the french and indian war the north american theater of the seven years war new england fought successfully against french acadia 
the british removed acadians from acadia nova scotia and replaced them with new england planters 
eventually some acadians resettled in louisiana where they developed a distinctive rural cajun culture that still exists 
they became american citizens in NUM with the louisiana purchase 
other french villages along the mississippi and illinois rivers were absorbed when the americans started arriving after NUM or settlers moved west to escape them 
french influence and language in new orleans louisiana and the gulf coast was more enduring new orleans was notable for its large population of free people of color before the civil war 
the strip of land along the eastern seacoast was settled primarily by english colonists in the NUMth century along with much smaller numbers of dutch and swedes 
colonial america was defined by a severe labor shortage that employed forms of unfree labor such as slavery and indentured servitude and by a british policy of benign neglect salutary neglect
over half of all european immigrants to colonial america arrived as indentured servants 
salutary neglect permitted the development of an american spirit distinct from that of its european founders 
the first successful english colony jamestown was established in NUM on the james river in virginia 
jamestown languished for decades until a new wave of settlers arrived in the late NUMth century and established commercial agriculture based on tobacco 
between the late NUMs and the revolution the british shipped an estimated NUM to NUM convicts to their american colonies 
a severe instance of conflict was the NUM powhatan uprising in virginia in which native americans killed hundreds of english settlers 
the largest conflicts between native americans and english settlers in the NUMth century were king philips war in new england and the yamasee war in south carolina 
new england was initially settled primarily by puritans 
the pilgrims established a settlement in NUM at plymouth colony which was followed by the establishment of the massachusetts bay colony in NUM
the middle colonies consisting of the present-day states of new york new jersey pennsylvania and delaware were characterized by a large degree of diversity 
the first attempted english settlement south of virginia was the province of carolina with georgia colony the last of the thirteen colonies established in NUM
the colonies were characterized by people primarily of the judeo-christian faiths with many congregationalists in new england german and dutch reformed in the middle colonies catholics in maryland and scots-irish presbyterians on the frontier 
sephardic jews were among early settlers in cities of new england and the south 
many immigrants arrived as religious refugees french huguenots settled in new york virginia and the carolinas 
many royal officials and merchants were anglicans 
religiosity expanded greatly after the first great awakening a religious revival in the NUMs led by preachers such as jonathan edwards and george whitefield 
american evangelicals affected by the awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the holy spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for god 
revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic setting the stage for the second great awakening beginning in the late NUMs 
in the early stages evangelicals in the south such as methodists and baptists preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers 
each of the NUM american colonies had a slightly different governmental structure 
typically a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from london who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote taxes and make laws 
by the NUMth century the american colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food 
the colonies were richer than most parts of britain and attracted a steady flow of immigrants especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants 
the tobacco and rice plantations imported african slaves for labor from the british colonies in the west indies and by the NUMs african slaves comprised a fifth of the american population 
the question of independence from britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed british military support against the french and spanish powers 
those threats were gone by NUM
london regarded the american colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country 
this policy is known as mercantilism 
an upper-class with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor and holding significant political power and even control over the churches emerged in south carolina and virginia 
a unique class system operated in upstate new york where dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy dutch proprietors such as the rensselaer family 
the other colonies were more equalitarian with pennsylvania being representative 
by the mid-NUMth century pennsylvania was basically a middle-class colony with limited deference to its small upper-class 
a writer in the pennsylvania journal in NUM summed it up
the people of this province are generally of the middling sort and at present pretty much upon a level 
they are chiefly industrious farmers artificers or men in trade they enjoy in are fond of freedom and the meanest among them thinks he has a right to civility from the greatest 
the french and indian war NUM was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies 
it was also part of the larger seven years war 
the influence of the main rivals of the british crown in the colonies and canada the french and north american indians was significantly reduced with the territory of the thirteen colonies expanding into new france both in canada and the louisiana territory 
moreover the war effort resulted in greater political integration of the colonies as reflected in the albany congress and symbolized by benjamin franklins call for the colonies to join or die
franklin was a man of many inventions one of which was the concept of a united states of america which emerged after NUM and was realized in july NUM
following britains acquisition of french territory in north america king george iii issued the royal proclamation of NUM with the goal of organizing the new north american empire and protecting the native indians from colonial expansion into western lands beyond the appalachian mountains 
in ensuing years strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the crown 
the british parliament passed the stamp act of NUM imposing a tax on the colonies without going through the colonial legislatures 
the issue was drawn did parliament have this right to tax americans who were not represented in it
crying no taxation without representation the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late NUMs and early NUMs 
the boston tea party in NUM was a direct action by activists in the town of boston to protest against the new tax on tea 
parliament quickly responded the next year with the coercive acts stripping massachusetts of its historic right of self-government and putting it under army rule which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies 
patriot leaders from all NUM colonies convened the first continental congress to coordinate their resistance to the coercive acts 
the congress called for a boycott of british trade published a list of rights and grievances and petitioned the king for redress of those grievances 
the appeal to the crown had no effect and so the second continental congress was convened in NUM to organize the defense of the colonies against the british army 
ordinary folk became insurgents against the british even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered 
they held very strongly a sense of rights that they felt the british were deliberately violating rights that stressed local autonomy fair dealing and government by consent 
they were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny which they saw manifested in the arrival in boston of the british army to punish the bostonians 
this heightened their sense of violated rights leading to rage and demands for revenge 
they had faith that god was on their side 
the american revolutionary war began at concord and lexington in april NUM when the british tried to seize ammunition supplies and arrest the patriot leaders 
in terms of political values the americans were largely united on a concept called republicanism that rejected aristocracy and emphasized civic duty and a fear of corruption 
for the founding fathers according to one team of historians republicanism represented more than a particular form of government 
it was a way of life a core ideology an uncompromising commitment to liberty and a total rejection of aristocracy 
the thirteen colonies began a rebellion against british rule in NUM and proclaimed their independence in NUM as the united states of america 
in the american revolutionary war NUM the americans captured the british invasion army at saratoga in NUM secured the northeast and encouraged the french to make a military alliance with the united states 
france brought in spain and the netherlands thus balancing the military and naval forces on each side as britain had no allies 
general george washington NUM proved an excellent organizer and administrator who worked successfully with congress and the state governors selecting and mentoring his senior officers supporting and training his troops and maintaining an idealistic republican army 
his biggest challenge was logistics since neither congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment munitions clothing paychecks or even the food supply of the soldiers 
as a battlefield tactician washington was often outmaneuvered by his british counterparts 
as a strategist however he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did 
the british sent four invasion armies 
washingtons strategy forced the first army out of boston in NUM and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at saratoga NUM and yorktown NUM
he limited the british control to new york city and a few places while keeping patriot control of the great majority of the population 
the loyalists whom the british counted upon too heavily comprised about NUM of the population but never were well organized 
as the war ended washington watched proudly as the final british army quietly sailed out of new york city in november NUM taking the loyalist leadership with them 
washington astonished the world when instead of seizing power for himself he retired quietly to his farm in virginia 
political scientist seymour martin lipset observes the united states was the first major colony successfully to revolt against colonial rule 
in this sense it was the first new nation.
on july NUM NUM the second continental congress meeting in philadelphia declared the independence of the united states of america in the declaration of independence 
july NUM is celebrated as the nations birthday 
historian george billias says

the new nation was founded on enlightenment ideals of liberalism in what thomas jefferson called the unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and dedicated strongly to republican principles 
republicanism emphasized the people are sovereign not hereditary kings demanded civic duty feared corruption and rejected any aristocracy 
every nation constructs and honors the memory of its founding following generations use it to establish its identity and define patriotism 
the revolution became the main source of the non-denominational american civil religion that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nations birth ever since 
key events and people were viewed as icons of fundamental virtues 
thus the revolution produced a moses-like leader george washington prophets thomas jefferson tom paine disciples alexander hamilton james madison and martyrs boston massacre nathan hale as well as devils benedict arnold
there are sacred places valley forge bunker hill rituals boston tea party emblems the new flag sacred days independence day and sacred scriptures whose every sentence is carefully studied the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights
in the NUMs the national government was able to settle the issue of the western territories which were ceded by the states to congress and became territories 
with the migration of settlers to the northwest soon they became states 
nationalists worried that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war or even internal revolts such as the shays rebellion of NUM in massachusetts 
nationalists most of them war veterans organized in every state and convinced congress to call the philadelphia convention in NUM
the delegates from every state wrote a new constitution that created a much more powerful and efficient central government one with a strong president and powers of taxation 
the new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of individual liberty and of constraining the power of government through a system of separation of powers 
the congress was given authority to ban the international slave trade after NUM years which it did in NUM
a compromise gave the south congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include three-fifths of the number of slaves in each states total population 
this provision increased the political power of southern representatives in congress especially as slavery was extended into the deep south through removal of native americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic trade 
to assuage the anti-federalists who feared a too-powerful national government the nation adopted the united states bill of rights in NUM
comprising the first ten amendments of the constitution it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice jury trials and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights which were not specified
george washington a renowned hero of the american revolutionary war commander-in-chief of the continental army and president of the constitutional convention became the first president of the united states under the new constitution in NUM
the national capital moved from new york to philadelphia and finally settled in washington dc in NUM
the major accomplishments of the washington administration were creating a strong national government that was recognized without question by all americans 
his government following the vigorous leadership of treasury secretary alexander hamilton assumed the debts of the states the debt holders received federal bonds created the bank of the united states to stabilize the financial system and set up a uniform system of tariffs taxes on imports and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure 
to support his programs hamilton created a new political party the first in the world based on voters the federalist party 
thomas jefferson and james madison formed an opposition republican party usually called the democratic-republican party by political scientists
hamilton and washington presented the country in NUM with the jay treaty that reestablished good relations with britain 
the jeffersonians vehemently protested and the voters aligned behind one party or the other thus setting up the first party system 
federalists promoted business financial and commercial interests and wanted more trade with britain 
republicans accused the federalists of plans to establish a monarchy turn the rich into a ruling class and making the united states a pawn of the british 
the treaty passed but politics became intensely heated 
the whiskey rebellion in NUM when western settlers protested against a federal tax on liquor was the first serious test of the federal government 
washington called out the state militia and personally led an army as the insurgents melted away and the power of the national government was firmly established 
washington refused to serve more than two terms setting a precedent and in his famous farewell address he extolled the benefits of federal government and importance of ethics and morality while warning against foreign alliances and the formation of political parties 
john adams a federalist defeated jefferson in the NUM election 
war loomed with france and the federalists used the opportunity to try to silence the republicans with the alien and sedition acts build up a large army with hamilton at the head and prepare for a french invasion 
however the federalists became divided after adams sent a successful peace mission to france that ended the quasi-war of NUM
during the first two decades after the revolutionary war there were dramatic changes in the status of slavery among the states and an increase in the number of freed blacks 
inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery northern states abolished slavery 
states of the upper south made manumission easier resulting in an increase in the proportion of free blacks in the upper south as a percentage of the total non-white population from less than one percent in NUM to more than NUM percent by NUM
by that date a total of NUM.NUM percent of all blacks in the united states were free 
after that date with the demand for slaves on the rise because of the deep souths expanding cotton cultivation the number of manumissions declined sharply and an internal us slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and traders 
in NUM president james madison severed the uss involvement with the atlantic slave trade 
jeffersons major achievement as president was the louisiana purchase in NUM which provided us settlers with vast potential for expansion west of the mississippi river 
jefferson a scientist himself supported expeditions to explore and map the new domain most notably the lewis and clark expedition 
jefferson believed deeply in republicanism and argued it should be based on the independent yeoman farmer and planter he distrusted cities factories and banks 
he also distrusted the federal government and judges and tried to weaken the judiciary 
however he met his match in john marshall a federalist from virginia 
although the constitution specified a supreme court its functions were vague until marshall the chief justice NUM defined them especially the power to overturn acts of congress or states that violated the constitution first enunciated in NUM in marbury v madison
thomas jefferson defeated adams for the presidency in the NUM election 
americans were increasingly angry at the british violation of american ships neutral rights in order to hurt france the impressment seizure of NUM american sailors needed by the royal navy to fight napoleon and british support for hostile indians attacking american settlers in the midwest 
they may also have desired to annex all or part of british north america 
despite strong opposition from the northeast especially from federalists who did not want to disrupt trade with britain congress declared war on june NUM NUM
the war was frustrating for both sides 
both sides tried to invade the other and were repulsed 
the american high command remained incompetent until the last year 
the american militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade canada repeatedly failed 
the british blockade ruined american commerce bankrupted the treasury and further angered new englanders who smuggled supplies to britain 
the americans under general william henry harrison finally gained naval control of lake erie and defeated the indians under tecumseh in canada while andrew jackson ended the indian threat in the southeast 
the indian threat to expansion into the midwest was permanently ended 
the british invaded and occupied much of maine 
the british raided and burned washington but were repelled at baltimore in NUM where the star spangled banner was written to celebrate the american success 
in upstate new york a major british invasion of new york state was turned back 
finally in early NUM andrew jackson decisively defeated a major british invasion at the battle of new orleans making him the most famous war hero 
with napoleon apparently gone the causes of the war had evaporated and both sides agreed to a peace that left the prewar boundaries intact 
americans claimed victory on february NUM NUM as news came almost simultaneously of jacksons victory of new orleans and the peace treaty that left the prewar boundaries in place 
americans swelled with pride at success in the second war of independence the naysayers of the antiwar federalist party were put to shame and the party never recovered 
the indians were the big losers they never gained the independent nationhood britain had promised and no longer posed a serious threat as settlers poured into the midwest 
as strong opponents of the war the federalists held the hartford convention in NUM that hinted at disunion 
national euphoria after the victory at new orleans ruined the prestige of the federalists and they no longer played a significant role as a political party 
president madison and most republicans realized they were foolish to let the bank of the united states close down for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war 
so with the assistance of foreign bankers they chartered the second bank of the united states in NUM
the republicans also imposed tariffs designed to protect the infant industries that had been created when britain was blockading the us with the collapse of the federalists as a party the adoption of many federalist principles by the republicans and the systematic policy of president james monroe in his two terms NUM to downplay partisanship the nation entered an era of good feelings with far less partisanship than before or after and closed out the first party system 
the monroe doctrine expressed in NUM proclaimed the united states opinion that european powers should no longer colonize or interfere in the americas 
this was a defining moment in the foreign policy of the united states 
the monroe doctrine was adopted in response to american and british fears over russian and french expansion into the western hemisphere 
in NUM president andrew jackson NUMth president of the united states ran for a second term under the slogan jackson and no bank and did not renew the charter of the second bank of the united states of america ending the bank in NUM
jackson was convinced that central banking was used by the elite to take advantage of the average american and instead implemented state banks popularly known as pet banks 
in NUM congress passed the indian removal act which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged native american tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the mississippi river 
its goal was primarily to remove native americans including the five civilized tribes from the american southeast they occupied land that settlers wanted 
jacksonian democrats demanded the forcible removal of native populations who refused to acknowledge state laws to reservations in the west whigs and religious leaders opposed the move as inhumane 
thousands of deaths resulted from the relocations as seen in the cherokee trail of tears 
many of the seminole indians in florida refused to move west they fought the army for years in the seminole wars 
after the first party system of federalists and republicans withered away in the NUMs the stage was set for the emergence of a new party system based on well organized local parties that appealed for the votes of almost all adult white men 
the former jeffersonian democratic-republican party split into factions 
they split over the choice of a successor to president james monroe and the party faction that supported many of the old jeffersonian principles led by andrew jackson and martin van buren became the democratic party 
as norton explains the transformation in NUM
jacksonians believed the peoples will had finally prevailed 
through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties political leaders and newspaper editors a popular movement had elected the president 
the democrats became the nations first well-organized national party ..and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century american politics 
opposing factions led by henry clay helped form the whig party 
the democratic party had a small but decisive advantage over the whigs until the NUMs when the whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery 
behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the democrats
the democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society 
they viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty 
the NUM corrupt bargain had strengthened their suspicion of washington politics ... jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power 
they believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich 
they sought to restore the independence of the individual the common man ie 
the artisan and the ordinary farmer by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency which they distrusted 
their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative and jacksons political power was largely expressed in negative acts 
he exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined 
jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement 
reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government 
but democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform mid the establishment of a public education system 
they believed for instance that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools 
nor did jackson share reformers humanitarian concerns 
he had no sympathy for american indians initiating the removal of the cherokees along the trail of tears 
the second great awakening was a protestant revival movement that affected the entire nation during the early NUMth century and led to rapid church growth 
the movement began around NUM gained momentum by NUM and after NUM membership rose rapidly among baptist and methodist congregations whose preachers led the movement 
it was past its peak by the NUMs 
it enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations 
many converts believed that the awakening heralded a new millennial age 
the second great awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements including abolitionism and temperance designed to remove the evils of society before the anticipated second coming of jesus christ 
after NUM the abolitionist movement redefined itself as a crusade against the sin of slave ownership 
it mobilized support especially among religious women in the northeast affected by the second great awakening
william lloyd garrison a radical abolitionist published the most influential of the many anti-slavery newspapers the liberator while frederick douglass an ex-slave began writing for that newspaper around NUM and started his own abolitionist newspaper north star in NUM
the great majority of anti-slavery activists such as abraham lincoln rejected garrisons theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil not a sin 
the american colonies and the new nation grew rapidly in population and area as pioneers pushed the frontier of settlement west 
the process finally ended around NUM as the last major farmlands and ranch lands were settled 
native american tribes in some places resisted militarily but they were overwhelmed by settlers and the army and after NUM were relocated to reservations in the west 
the highly influential frontier thesis of wisconsin historian frederick jackson turner argues that the frontier shaped the national character with its boldness violence innovation individualism and democracy 
recent historians have emphasized the multicultural nature of the frontier 
enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the wild west of the second half of the NUMth century 
as defined by hine and faragher frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities the use of the land the development of markets and the formation of states
they explain it is a tale of conquest but also one of survival persistence and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to america 
the first settlers in the west were the spanish in new mexico they became us citizens in NUM
the hispanics in california californios were overwhelmed by over NUM gold rush miners 
california grew explosively 
san francisco by NUM had become the economic hub of the entire pacific coast with a diverse population of a quarter million 
from the early NUMs to NUM the oregon trail and its many offshoots were used by over NUM settlers 
NUMers in the california gold rush ranchers farmers and entrepreneurs and their families headed to california oregon and other points in the far west 
wagon-trains took five or six months on foot after NUM the trip took NUM days by rail 
manifest destiny was the belief that american settlers were destined to expand across the continent 
this concept was born out of a sense of mission to redeem the old world by high example  .. generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven 
manifest destiny was rejected by modernizers especially the whigs like henry clay and abraham lincoln who wanted to build cities and factories not more farms 
democrats strongly favored expansion and won the key election of NUM
after a bitter debate in congress the republic of texas was annexed in NUM leading to war with mexico who considered texas to be a part of mexico due to the large numbers of mexican settlers 
the mexicanamerican war NUM broke out with the whigs opposed to the war and the democrats supporting the war 
the us army using regulars and large numbers of volunteers defeated the mexican armies invaded at several points captured mexico city and won decisively 
the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo ended the war in NUM
many democrats wanted to annex all of mexico but that idea was rejected by southerners who argued that by incorporating millions of mexican people mainly of mixed race would undermine the united states as an exclusively white republic 
instead the us took texas and the lightly settled northern parts california and new mexico
the hispanic residents were given full citizenship and the mexican indians became american indians 
simultaneously gold was discovered in california in NUM attracting over NUM men to northern california in a matter of months in the california gold rush 
a peaceful compromise with britain gave the us ownership of the oregon country which was renamed the oregon territory 
the central issue after NUM was the expansion of slavery pitting the anti-slavery elements in the north against the pro-slavery elements that dominated the south 
a small number of active northerners were abolitionists who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin in terms of protestant theology and demanded its immediate abolition 
much larger numbers in the north were against the expansion of slavery seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that america would be committed to free land as in low-cost farms owned and cultivated by a family free labor and free speech as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the south
southern whites insisted that slavery was of economic social and cultural benefit to all whites and even to the slaves themselves and denounced all anti-slavery spokesmen as abolitionists 
justifications of slavery included economics history religion legality social good and even humanitarianism to further their arguments 
defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and killing economic impact in the south where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy 
they also argued that if all the slaves were freed there would be widespread unemployment and chaos 
religious activists split on slavery with the methodists and baptists dividing into northern and southern denominations 
in the north the methodists congregationalists and quakers included many abolitionists especially among women activists 
the catholic episcopal and lutheran denominations largely ignored the slavery issue 
the issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the compromise of NUM brokered by whig henry clay and democrat stephen douglas the compromise included the admission of california as a free state in exchange for no federal restrictions on slavery placed on utah or new mexico 
the point of contention was the fugitive slave act which increased federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in turning over fugitive slaves to their owners 
abolitionists pounced on the act to attack slavery as in the best-selling anti-slavery novel uncle toms cabin by harriet beecher stowe 
the compromise of NUM was repealed in NUM with the kansasnebraska act promoted by senator douglas in the name of popular sovereignty and democracy 
it permitted voters to decide on the legality slavery in each territory and allowed douglas to adopt neutrality on the issue of slavery 
anti-slavery forces rose in anger and alarm forming the new republican party 
pro- and anti- contingents rushed to kansas to vote slavery up or down resulting in a miniature civil war called bleeding kansas 
by the late NUMs the young republican party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college 
it insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand and thus would slowly die out
the southern slavery-based societies had become wealthy based on their cotton and other agricultural commodity production and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade 
northern cities such as boston and new york and regional industries were tied economically to slavery by banking shipping and manufacturing including textile mills 
by NUM there were four million slaves in the south nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in NUM
the plantations were highly profitable due to the heavy european demand for raw cotton 
most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves largely drawn from the declining tobacco regions
for NUM of the nations first NUM years a slaveholder served as president of the united states and during that period only slaveholding presidents were re-elected to second terms 
in addition southern states benefited by their increased apportionment in congress due to the partial counting of slaves in their populations 
slave rebellions by gabriel prosser NUM denmark vesey NUM nat turner NUM and most famously by john brown NUM caused fear in the white south which imposed stricter oversight of slaves and reduced the rights of free blacks 
the fugitive slave act of NUM required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves which outraged northerners 
formerly an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the missouri compromise 
the supreme courts NUM decision in dred scott v sandford ruled that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional angry republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution 
after abraham lincoln won the NUM election seven southern states seceded from the union and set up a new nation the confederate states of america confederacy on february NUM NUM
it attacked fort sumter a us army fort in south carolina thus igniting the war 
when lincoln called for troops to suppress the confederacy in april NUM four more states seceded and joined the confederacy 
a few of the northernmost slave states did not secede and became known as the border states these were delaware maryland kentucky and missouri 
during the war the northwestern portion of virginia seceded from the confederacy 
and became the new union state of west virginia 
west virginia is usually associated with the border states 
the civil war began on april NUM NUM when elements of NUM confederate forces attacked a us military installation at fort sumter in south carolina 
in response to the attack on april NUM lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling NUM troops to recapture forts protect the capital and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states 
the two armies had their first major clash at the first battle of bull run battle of manassas ending in a union defeat but more importantly proved to both the union and confederacy that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated 
the war soon divided into two theaters eastern and western 
in the western theater the union was relatively successful with major battles such as perryville and shiloh along with union gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic union victories and destroying major confederate operations 
warfare in the eastern theater began poorly for the union as the confederates won at manassas junction bull run just outside washington 
major general george b mcclellan was put in charge of the union armies 
after reorganizing the new army of the potomac mcclellan failed to capture the confederate capital of richmond virginia in his peninsula campaign and retreated after attacks from newly appointed confederate general robert e lee 
meanwhile both sides concentrated in NUM on raising and training new armies 
the main action was union success in controlling the border states with confederates largely driven out of maryland west virginia a new state kentucky and missouri 
the autumn NUM confederate campaign into maryland was designed to hurt union morale and win european support 
it ended with confederate retreat at the battle of antietam and lincolns warning he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january NUM if the states did not return 
making slavery a central war goal energized republicans in the north as well as their enemies the anti-war copperhead democrats 
it ended the risk of british and french intervention 
lees smaller army won at the battle of fredericksburg late in NUM causing yet another change in commanders 
lee won again at the battle of chancellorsville in may NUM while losing his top aide stonewall jackson 
but lee pushed too hard and ignored the union threat in the west 
lee invaded pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause war-weariness in the north 
in perhaps the turning point of the war lees army was badly beaten at the battle of gettysburg july NUM NUM and barely made it back to virginia 
on the homefront industrial expansion in the north expanded dramatically using its extensive railroad service and moving industrial workers into munitions factories 
foreign trade increased with the united states providing both food and cotton to britain and britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the union army plus a few to the confederates
the british operated blockade runners bringing in food luxury items and munitions to the confederacy bringing out tobacco and cotton 
the union blockade increasingly shut down confederate ports and by late NUM the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than handful of runs 
in the west on july NUM NUM union forces under the command of general ulysses s grant gained control of the mississippi river at the battle of vicksburg thereby splitting the confederacy 
lincoln made general grant commander of all union armies 
grant put general william tecumseh sherman in charge of the western armies 
in NUM sherman marched south from chattanooga to capture atlanta a decisive victory that ended war jitters among republicans in the north who feared they might fail to reelect lincoln in NUM
lincoln won a landslide 
the last two years of the war were bloody for both sides with sherman marching almost unopposed through central and eastern georgia then moving up through south carolina and north carolina burning cities destroying plantations ruining railroads and bridges but avoiding civilian casualties 
sherman demonstrated that the south line the long-term ability to resist a northern invasion 
much of the heartland of the confederacy was physically destroyed and could no longer provide desperately needed food horses mules wagons boots or munitions to its combat armies 
in spring NUM grant realizing that lee was unable to replenishes casualties while lincoln would provide replacements for union losses launched a war of attrition against lees army of northern virginia 
this war of attrition was divided into three main campaigns 
the first of these the overland campaign forced lee to retreat into the city of petersburg where grant launched his second major offensive the richmond-petersburg campaign in which he besieged petersburg 
after a near ten-month siege petersburg surrendered 
however the defense of fort gregg allowed lee to move his army out of petersburg 
grant pursued and launched the final appomattox campaign which resulted in lee surrendering his army of northern virginia numbering NUM on april NUM NUM at appomattox court house 
other confederate armies followed suit and the war ended with no postwar insurgency 
the american civil war was the worlds earliest industrial war 
railroads the telegraph steamships and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively 
the mobilization of civilian factories mines shipyards banks transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in world war i 
it remains the deadliest war in american history resulting in the deaths of about NUM soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties 
about ten percent of all northern males NUM years old and NUM percent of all southern white males aged NUM died 
its legacy includes ending slavery in the united states restoring the union and strengthening the role of the federal government 
according to historian allan nevins the civil war had a major long-term impact on the united states in terms of developing its leadership potential and moving the entire nation beyond the adolescent stage

the emancipation proclamation was an executive order issued by president abraham lincoln on january NUM NUM
in a single stroke it changed the legal status as recognized by the us government of NUM million slaves in designated areas of the confederacy from slave to free 
it had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the confederate government by running away or through advances of federal troops the slave became legally and actually free 
the owners were never compensated 
plantation owners realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the union army 
by june NUM the union army controlled all of the confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves 
large numbers moved into camps run by the freedmens bureau where they were given food shelter medical care and arrangements for their employment were made 
the severe dislocations of war and reconstruction had a large negative impact on the black population with a large amount of sickness and death 
reconstruction lasted from lincolns emancipation proclamation of january NUM NUM to the compromise of NUM
the major issues faced by lincoln were the status of the ex-slaves called freedmen the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels the status of the NUM ex-confederate states the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war and the question of whether congress or the president would make the major decisions 
the severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency the freedmens bureau operated by the army 
three reconstruction amendments were passed to expand civil rights for black americans the thirteenth amendment outlawed slavery the fourteenth amendment guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship for blacks the fifteenth amendment prevented race from being used to disfranchise men 
ex-confederates remained in control of most southern states for over two years but changed when the radical republicans gained control of congress in the NUM elections 
president andrew johnson who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels was virtually powerless in the face of the radical republican congress he was impeached but the senates attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote 
congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many ex-confederate leaders of the right to hold office 
new republican governments came to power based on a coalition of freedmen made up of carpetbaggers new arrivals from the north and scalawags native white southerners
they were backed by the us army 
opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites 
state by state they lost power to a conservative-democratic coalition which gained control of the entire south by NUM
in response to radical reconstruction the ku klux klan kkk emerged in NUM as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and republican rule 
president ulysses grants vigorous enforcement of the ku klux klan act of NUM shut down the klan and it disbanded 
paramilitary groups such as the white league and red shirts emerged about NUM that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the south during the NUMs 
rable described them as the military arm of the democratic party 
reconstruction ended after the disputed NUM election 
the compromise of NUM gave republican candidate rutherford b hayes the white house in exchange for removing all remaining federal troops in the south 
the federal government withdrew its troops from the south and southern democrats took control of every southern state 
from NUM to NUM southern states effectively disfranchised most black voters and many poor whites by making voter registration more difficult through poll taxes literacy tests and other arbitrary devices 
they passed segregation laws and imposed second-class status on blacks in a system known as jim crow that lasted until the civil rights movement 
the latter half of the nineteenth century was marked by the rapid development and settlement of the far west first by wagon trains and riverboats and then aided by the completion of the transcontinental railroad 
large numbers of european immigrants especially from germany and scandinavia took up low-cost or free farms in the prairie states 
mining for silver and copper opened up the mountain west 
the united states army fought frequent small-scale wars with native americans as settlers encroached on their traditional lands 
gradually the us purchased the native american tribal lands and extinguished their claims forcing most tribes onto subsidized reservations 
according to the us bureau of the census NUM from NUM to NUM
the indian wars under the government of the united states have been more than NUM in number 
they have cost the lives of about NUM white men women and children including those killed in individual combats and the lives of about NUM indians 
the actual number of killed and wounded indians must be very much higher than the given .. fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate .
the gilded age was a term that mark twain used to describe the period of the late NUMth century with a dramatic expansion of american wealth and prosperity underscored by the mass corruption in the government 
reforms of the age included the civil service act which mandated a competitive examination for applicants for government jobs 
other important legislation included the interstate commerce act which ended railroads discrimination against small shippers and the sherman antitrust act which outlawed monopolies in business 
twain believed that this age was corrupted by such elements as land speculators scandalous politics and unethical business practices 
since the days of charles a 
beard and matthew josephson some historians have argued that the united states was effectively plutocratic for at least part of the gilded age and progressive era 
as financiers and industrialists such as jp morgan and john d rockefeller began to amass vast fortunes many us observers were concerned that the nation was losing its pioneering egalitarian spirit 
by NUM american industrial production and per capita income exceeded those of all other world nations 
in response to heavy debts and decreasing farm prices wheat and cotton farmers joined the populist party 
an unprecedented wave of immigration from europe served to both provide the labor for american industry and create diverse communities in previously undeveloped areas 
from NUM to NUM peak years of immigration more than NUM million people migrated to the united states 
most were unskilled workers who quickly found jobs in mines mills factories 
many immigrants were craftsmen especially from britain and germany bringing human skills and others were farmers especially from germany and scandinavia who purchased inexpensive land on the prairies from railroads who sent agents to europe 
poverty growing inequality and dangerous working conditions along with socialist and anarchist ideas diffusing from european immigrants led to the rise of the labor movement which often included violent strikes 
skilled workers banded together to control their crafts and raise wages by forming labor unions in industrial areas of the northeast 
before the NUMs few factory workers joined the unions in the labor movement 
samuel gompers led the american federation of labor NUM coordinating multiple unions 
industrial growth was rapid led by john d rockefeller in oil and andrew carnegie in steel both became leaders of philanthropy gospel of wealth giving away their fortunes to create the modern system of hospitals universities libraries and foundations 
the panic of NUM broke out and was a severe nationwide depression impacting farmers workers and businessmen who saw prices wages and profits fall 
many railroads went bankrupt 
the resultant political reaction fell on the democratic party whose leader president grover cleveland shouldered much of the blame 
labor unrest involved numerous strikes most notably the violent pullman strike of NUM which was shut down by federal troops under clevelands orders 
the populist party gained strength among cotton and wheat farmers as well as coal miners but was overtaken by the even more popular free silver movement which demanded using silver to enlarge the money supply leading to inflation that the silverites promised would end the depression 
the financial railroad and business communities fought back hard arguing that only the gold standard would save the economy 
in the most intense election in the nations history conservative republican william mckinley defeated silverite william jennings bryan who ran on the democratic populist and silver republican tickets 
bryan swept the south and west but mckinley ran up landslides among the middle class industrial workers cities and among upscale farmers in the midwest 
prosperity returned under mckinley the gold standard was enacted and the tariff was raised 
by NUM the us had the strongest economy on the globe 
apart from two short recessions in NUM and NUM the overall economy remained prosperous and growing until NUM
republicans citing mckinleys policies took the credit 
dissatisfaction on the part of the growing middle class with the corruption and inefficiency of politics as usual and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems led to the dynamic progressive movement starting in the NUMs 
in every major city and state and at the national level as well and in education medicine and industry the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions the elimination of corruption in politics and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change 
leading politicians from both parties most notably theodore roosevelt charles evans hughes and robert la follette on the republican side and william jennings bryan and woodrow wilson on the democratic side took up the cause of progressive reform 
women became especially involved in demands for woman suffrage prohibition and better schools their most prominent leader was jane addams of chicago who created settlement houses 
muckraking journalists such as upton sinclair lincoln steffens and jacob riis exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant inner city poverty 
progressives implemented anti-trust laws and regulated such industries of meat-packing drugs and railroads 
four new constitutional amendments the sixteenth through nineteenth resulted from progressive activism bringing the federal income tax direct election of senators prohibition and woman suffrage 
the progressive movement lasted through the NUMs the most active period was NUM
the united states emerged as a world economic and military power after NUM
the main episode was the spanishamerican war which began when spain refused american demands to reform its oppressive policies in cuba 
the splendid little war as one official called it involved a series of quick american victories on land and at sea 
at the treaty of paris peace conference the united states acquired the philippines puerto rico and guam 
cuba became an independent country under close american tutelage 
although the war itself was widely popular the peace terms proved controversial 
william jennings bryan led his democratic party in opposition to control of the philippines which he denounced as imperialism unbecoming to american democracy 
president william mckinley defended the acquisition and was riding high as the nation had returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war 
mckinley easily defeated bryan in a rematch in the NUM presidential election 
after defeating an insurrection by filipino nationalists the united states engaged in a large-scale program to modernize the economy of the philippines and dramatically upgrade the public health facilities 
by NUM however americans lost interest in an empire and turned their international attention to the caribbean especially the building of the panama canal 
in NUM when arizona became the final mainland state the american frontier came to an end 
the canal opened in NUM and increased trade with japan and the rest of the far east 
a key innovation was the open door policy whereby the imperial powers were given equal access to chinese business with not one of them allowed to take control of china 
as world war i raged in europe from NUM president woodrow wilson took full control of foreign policy declaring neutrality but warning germany that resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against american ships supplying goods to allied nations would mean war 
germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off supplies to britain through the sinking of ships such as the rms lusitania the us declared war in april NUM mainly from the threat of the zimmermann telegram 
american money food and munitions arrived quickly but troops had to be drafted and trained by summer NUM american soldiers under general john j pershing arrived at the rate of NUM a day while germany was unable to replace its losses 
the result was allied victory in november NUM
president wilson demanded germany depose the kaiser and accept his terms in the famed fourteen points speech 
wilson dominated the NUM paris peace conference but germany was treated harshly by the allies in the treaty of versailles NUM as wilson put all his hopes in the new league of nations 
wilson refused to compromise with senate republicans over the issue of congressional power to declare war and the senate rejected the treaty and the league 
the womens suffrage movement began with the june NUM national convention of the liberty party 
presidential candidate gerrit smith argued for and established womens suffrage as a party plank 
one month later his cousin elizabeth cady stanton joined with lucretia mott and other women to organize the seneca falls convention featuring the declaration of sentiments demanding equal rights for women and the right to vote 
many of these activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement 
the womens rights campaign during first-wave feminism was led by stanton lucy stone and susan b anthony among many others 
stone and paulina wright davis organized the prominent and influential national womens rights convention in NUM
the movement reorganized after the civil war gaining experienced campaigners many of whom had worked for prohibition in the womens christian temperance union 
by the end of the NUMth century a few western states had granted women full voting rights though women had made significant legal victories gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody 
around NUM the feminist movement began to reawaken putting an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of american politics demanded purification by women because men could not do that job 
protests became increasingly common as suffragette alice paul led parades through the capital and major cities 
paul split from the large national american woman suffrage association nawsa which favored a more moderate approach and supported the democratic party and woodrow wilson led by carrie chapman catt and formed the more militant national womans party 
suffragists were arrested during their silent sentinels pickets at the white house the first time such a tactic was used and were taken as political prisoners 
the old anti-suffragist argument that only men could fight a war and therefore only men deserve the right to vote was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of american women on the home front in world war i 
across the world grateful nations gave women the right to vote 
furthermore most of the western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections and the representatives from those states including the first woman jeannette rankin of montana demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success 
the main resistance came from the south where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting 
congress passed the nineteenth amendment in NUM and women could vote in NUM
nawsa became the league of women voters and the national womans party began lobbying for full equality and the equal rights amendment which would pass congress during the second wave of the womens movement in NUM
politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women especially prohibition child health and world peace 
the main surge of women voting came in NUM when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect al smith a catholic from new york city 
meanwhile protestants mobilized women to support prohibition and vote for republican herbert hoover 
in the NUMs the us grew steadily in stature as an economic and military world power 
the united states senate did not ratify the treaty of versailles imposed by its allies on the defeated central powers instead the united states chose to pursue unilateralism 
the aftershock of russias october revolution resulted in real fears of communism in the united states leading to a red scare and the deportation of aliens considered subversive 
while public health facilities grew rapidly in the progressive era and hospitals and medical schools were modernized the nation in NUM lost NUM lives to the spanish flu pandemic 
in NUM the manufacture sale import and export of alcohol were prohibited by the eighteenth amendment prohibition 
the result was that in cities illegal alcohol became a big business largely controlled by racketeers 
the second ku klux klan grew rapidly in NUM then collapsed 
immigration laws were passed to strictly limit the number of new entries 
the NUMs were called the roaring twenties due to the great economic prosperity during this period 
jazz became popular among the younger generation and thus the decade was also called the jazz age 
the great depression NUM and the new deal NUM were decisive moments in american political economic and social history that reshaped the nation 
during the NUMs the nation enjoyed widespread prosperity albeit with a weakness in agriculture 
a financial bubble was fueled by an inflated stock market which later led to the stock market crash on october NUM NUM
this along with many other economic factors triggered a worldwide depression known as the great depression 
during this time the united states experienced deflation as prices fell unemployment soared from NUM in NUM to NUM in NUM farm prices fell by half and manufacturing output plunged by one-third 
in NUM democratic presidential nominee franklin d roosevelt promised a new deal for the american people coining the enduring label for his domestic policies 
the desperate economic situation along with the substantial democratic victories in the NUM elections gave roosevelt unusual influence over congress in the first hundred days of his administration 
he used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system stock market industry and agriculture along with many other government efforts to end the great depression and reform the american economy 
the new deal regulated much of the economy especially the financial sector 
it provided relief to the unemployed through numerous programs such as the works progress administration wpa and for young men the civilian conservation corps that undertook jobs such as forest fire fighting and creating public works 
large scale spending projects designed to provide high paying jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the public works administration 
roosevelt turned left in NUM building up labor unions through the wagner act 
unions became a powerful element of the merging new deal coalition which won reelection for roosevelt in NUM NUM and NUM by mobilizing union members blue collar workers relief recipients big city machines ethnic and religious groups especially catholics and jews and the white south along with blacks in the north where they could vote
some of the programs were dropped in the NUMs when the conservatives regained power in congress through the conservative coalition 
of special importance is the social security program begun in NUM
in the depression years the united states remained focused on domestic concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries fell under the control of dictators 
imperial japan asserted dominance in east asia and in the pacific 
nazi germany and fascist italy militarized and threatened conquests while britain and france attempted appeasement to avert another war in europe 
us legislation in the neutrality acts sought to avoid foreign conflicts however policy clashed with increasing anti-nazi feelings following the german invasion of poland in september NUM that started world war ii 
roosevelt positioned the us as the arsenal of democracy pledging full-scale financial and munitions support for the allies but no military personnel 
this was carried out through the lend-lease agreements 
japan tried to neutralize americas power in the pacific by attacking pearl harbor on december NUM NUM which catalyzed american support to enter the war 
the main contributions of the us to the allied war effort comprised money industrial output food petroleum technological innovation and especially NUM military personnel 
much of the focus in washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation 
the overall result was a dramatic increase in gdp the export of vast quantities of supplies to the allies and to american forces overseas the end of unemployment and a rise in civilian consumption even as NUM of the gdp went to the war effort 
this was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs improvements in productivity through better technology and management and the move into the active labor force of students retired people housewives and the unemployed and an increase in hours worked 
it was exhausting leisure activities declined sharply 
people tolerated the extra work because of patriotism the pay and the confidence that it was only for the duration and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won 
most durable goods became unavailable and meat clothing and gasoline were tightly rationed 
in industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters 
prices and wages were controlled and americans saved a high portion of their incomes which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression 
the allies the united states britain and the soviet union china as well as poland canada and other countries fought the axis powers of germany italy and japan 
the allies saw germany as the main threat and gave highest priority to europe 
the us dominated the war against japan and stopped japanese expansion in the pacific in NUM
after losing pearl harbor and in the philippines to the japanese and drawing the battle of the coral sea may NUM the american navy inflicted a decisive blow at midway june NUM
american ground forces assisted in the north african campaign that eventually concluded with the collapse of mussolinis fascist government in NUM as italy switched to the allied side 
a more significant european front was opened on d-day june NUM NUM in which american and allied forces invaded nazi-occupied france from britain 
on the home front mobilization of the us economy was managed by roosevelts war production board 
the wartime production boom led to full employment wiping out this vestige of the great depression 
indeed labor shortages encouraged industry to look for new sources of workers finding new roles for women and blacks 
however the fervor also inspired anti-japanese sentiment leading to internment of japanese-americans 
research and development took flight as well best seen in the manhattan project a secret effort to harness nuclear fission to produce highly destructive atomic bombs 
the allies pushed the germans out of france but faced an unexpected counterattack at the battle of the bulge in december 
the final german effort failed and as allied armies in east and west were converging on berlin the nazis hurriedly tried to kill the last remaining jews 
the western front stopped short leaving berlin to the soviets as the nazi regime formally capitulated in may NUM ending the war in europe 
over in the pacific the us implemented an island hopping strategy toward tokyo establishing airfields for bombing runs against mainland japan from the mariana islands and achieving hard-fought victories at iwo jima and okinawa in NUM
bloodied at okinawa the us prepared to invade japans home islands when b-NUMs dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki forcing the empires surrender in a matter of days and thus ending world war ii 
the us occupied japan and part of germany sending douglas macarthur to restructure the japanese economy and political system along american lines 
during the war roosevelt coined the term four powers to refer four major allies of world war ii the united states the united kingdom the soviet union and china which later became the foundation of the united nations security council 
though the nation lost more than NUM military personnel the mainland prospered untouched by the devastation of war that inflicted a heavy toll on europe and asia 
participation in postwar foreign affairs marked the end of predominant american isolationism 
the awesome threat of nuclear weapons inspired both optimism and fear 
nuclear weapons were never used after NUM as both sides drew back from the brink and a long peace characterized the cold war years starting with the truman doctrine in may NUM NUM
there were however regional wars in korea and vietnam 
following world war ii the united states emerged as one of the two dominant superpowers the ussr being the other 
the us senate on a bipartisan vote approved us participation in the united nations un which marked a turn away from the traditional isolationism of the us and toward increased international involvement 
the primary american goal of NUM was to rescue europe from the devastation of world war ii and to contain the expansion of communism represented by the soviet union 
us foreign policy during the cold war was built around the support of western europe and japan along with the policy of containment stopping the spread of communism 
the us joined the wars in korea and vietnam to try to stop its spread 
the truman doctrine of NUM provided military and economic aid to greece and turkey to counteract the threat of communist expansion in the balkans 
in NUM the united states replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive marshall plan which pumped money into the economy of western europe and removed trade barriers while modernizing the managerial practices of businesses and governments 
the plans NUM billion budget was in the context of a us gdp of NUM billion in NUM and was in addition to the NUM billion in american aid given to europe between the end of the war and the start of the marshall plan 
soviet head of state joseph stalin prevented his satellite states from participating and from that point on eastern europe with inefficient centralized economies fell further and further behind western europe in terms of economic development and prosperity 
in NUM the united states rejecting the long-standing policy of no military alliances in peacetime formed the north atlantic treaty organization nato alliance which continues into the NUMst century 
in response the soviets formed the warsaw pact of communist states leading to the iron curtain
in august NUM the soviets tested their first nuclear weapon thereby escalating the risk of warfare 
the threat of mutually assured destruction however prevented both powers from nuclear war and resulted in proxy wars especially in korea and vietnam in which the two sides did not directly confront each other 
within the united states the cold war prompted concerns about communist influence 
the unexpected leapfrogging of american technology by the soviets in NUM with sputnik the first earth satellite began the space race won by the americans as apollo NUM landed astronauts on the moon in NUM
the angst about the weaknesses of american education led to large-scale federal support for science education and research 
in the decades after world war ii the united states became a global influence in economic political military cultural and technological affairs 
beginning in the NUMs middle-class culture became obsessed with consumer goods 
white americans made up nearly NUM of the population in NUM
in NUM the charismatic politician john f kennedy was elected as the first and thus far only roman catholic president of the united states 
the kennedy family brought a new life and vigor to the atmosphere of the white house 
his time in office was marked by such notable events as the acceleration of the united states role in the space race escalation of the american role in the vietnam war the cuban missile crisis the bay of pigs invasion the jailing of martin luther king jr during the birmingham campaign and the appointment of his brother robert f kennedy to his cabinet as attorney general 
kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas on november NUM NUM leaving the nation in profound shock 
the climax of liberalism came in the mid-NUMs with the success of president lyndon b johnson NUM in securing congressional passage of his great society programs 
they included civil rights the end of segregation medicare extension of welfare federal aid to education at all levels subsidies for the arts and humanities environmental activism and a series of programs designed to wipe out poverty 
as recent historians have explained
gradually liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving economic and social justice 
the liberalism of the early NUMs contained no hint of radicalism little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power and no intention to redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions 
internationally it was strongly anti-communist 
it aimed to defend the free world to encourage economic growth at home and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed 
their agenda-much influenced by keynesian economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare housing health and educational programs 
johnson was rewarded with an electoral landslide in NUM against conservative barry goldwater which broke the decades-long control of congress by the conservative coalition 
however the republicans bounced back in NUM and elected richard nixon in NUM
nixon largely continued the new deal and great society programs he inherited conservative reaction would come with the election of ronald reagan in NUM
meanwhile the american people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion 
starting in the late NUMs institutionalized racism across the united states but especially in the south was increasingly challenged by the growing civil rights movement 
the activism of african-american leaders rosa parks and martin luther king jr led to the montgomery bus boycott which launched the movement 
for years african americans would struggle with violence against them but would achieve great steps toward equality with supreme court decisions including brown v board of education and loving v virginia the civil rights act of NUM the voting rights act of NUM and the fair housing act of NUM which ended the jim crow laws that legalized racial segregation between whites and blacks 
martin luther king jr  who had won the nobel peace prize for his efforts to achieve equality of the races was assassinated in NUM
following his death others led the movement most notably kings widow coretta scott king who was also active like her husband in the opposition to the vietnam war and in the womens liberation movement 
there were NUM riots in NUM american cities in the first nine months of NUM
frustrations with the seemingly slow progress of the integration movement led to the emergence of more radical discourses during the early NUMs which in turn gave rise to the black power movement of the late NUMs and early NUMs 
the decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward integration especially in government service sports and entertainment 
native americans turned to the federal courts to fight for their land rights 
they held protests highlighting the federal governments failure to honor treaties 
one of the most outspoken native american groups was the american indian movement aim
in the NUMs cesar chavez began organizing poorly paid mexican-american farm workers in california 
he led a five-year-long strike by grape pickers 
then chvez formed the nations first successful union of farm workers 
his united farm workers of america ufw faltered after a few years but after chavez died in NUM he became an iconic folk saint in the pantheon of mexican americans 
a new consciousness of the inequality of american women began sweeping the nation starting with the NUM publication of betty friedans best-seller the feminine mystique which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled assaulted american culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives mothers and keepers of the home and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job 
in NUM friedan and others established the national organization for women or now to act for women as the naacp did for african americans 
protests began and the new womens liberation movement grew in size and power gained much media attention and by NUM had replaced the civil rights movement as the uss main social revolution 
marches parades rallies boycotts and pickets brought out thousands sometimes millions 
there were striking gains for women in medicine law and business while only a few were elected to office 
the movement was split into factions by political ideology early on however with now on the left the womens equity action league weal on the right the national womens political caucus nwpc in the center and more radical groups formed by younger women on the far left
the proposed equal rights amendment to the constitution passed by congress in NUM was defeated by a conservative coalition mobilized by phyllis schlafly 
they argued that it degraded the position of the housewife and made young women susceptible to the military draft 
however many federal laws ie  those equalizing pay employment education employment opportunities and credit ending pregnancy discrimination and requiring nasa the military academies and other organizations to admit women state laws ie  those ending spousal abuse and marital rape supreme court rulings ie 
ruling that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment applied to women and state eras established womens equal status under the law and social custom and consciousness began to change accepting womens equality 
the controversial issue of abortion deemed by the supreme court as a fundamental right in roe v wade NUM is still a point of debate today 
amid the cold war the united states entered the vietnam war whose growing unpopularity fed already existing social movements including those among women minorities and young people 
president lyndon b johnsons great society social programs and numerous rulings by the warren court added to the wide range of social reform during the NUMs and NUMs 
feminism and the environmental movement became political forces and progress continued toward civil rights for all americans 
the counterculture revolution swept through the nation and much of the western world in the late sixties and early seventies further dividing americans in a culture war but also bringing forth more liberated social views 
johnson was succeeded in NUM by republican richard nixon who attempted to gradually turn the war over to the south vietnamese forces 
he negotiated the peace treaty in NUM which secured the release of pows and led to the withdrawal of us troops 
the war had cost the lives of NUM american troops 
nixon manipulated the fierce distrust between the soviet union and china to the advantage of the united states achieving dtente relaxation ease of tension with both parties 
the watergate scandal involving nixons cover-up of his operatives break-in into the democratic national committee headquarters at the watergate office complex destroyed his political base sent many aides to prison and forced nixons resignation on august NUM NUM
he was succeeded by vice president gerald ford 
the fall of saigon ended the vietnam war and resulted in north and south vietnam being reunited 
communist victories in neighboring cambodia and laos occurred in the same year 
the opec oil embargo marked a long-term economic transition since for the first time energy prices skyrocketed and american factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles clothing electronics and consumer goods 
by the late NUMs the economy suffered an energy crisis slow economic growth high unemployment and very high inflation coupled with high interest rates the term stagflation was coined
since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation many of the new deal era regulations were ended such as in transportation banking and telecommunications 
jimmy carter running as someone who was not a part of the washington political establishment was elected president in NUM
on the world stage carter brokered the camp david accords between israel and egypt 
in NUM iranian students stormed the us embassy in tehran and took NUM americans hostage resulting in the iran hostage crisis 
with the hostage crisis and continuing stagflation carter lost the NUM election to the republican ronald reagan 
on january NUM NUM minutes after carters term in office ended the remaining us captives held at the us embassy in iran were released ending the NUM-day hostage crisis 
ronald reagan produced a major realignment with his NUM and NUM landslide elections 
reagans economic policies dubbed reaganomics and the implementation of the economic recovery tax act of NUM lowered the top marginal tax rate from NUM to NUM over the course of seven years 
reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation 
the us experienced a recession in NUM but the negative indicators reversed with the inflation rate decreasing from NUM to NUM the unemployment rate decreasing from NUM.NUM in december NUM to NUM.NUM in november NUM and the economic growth rate increasing from NUM.NUM to NUM.NUM
reagan ordered a buildup of the us military incurring additional budget deficits 
reagan introduced a complicated missile defense system known as the strategic defense initiative sdi dubbed star wars by opponents in which theoretically the us could shoot down missiles with laser systems in space 
the soviets reacted harshly because they thought it violated the NUM anti-ballistic missile treaty and would upset the balance of power by giving the us a major military advantage 
for years soviet leader mikhail gorbachev argued vehemently against sdi 
however by the late NUMs he decided the system would never work and should not be used to block disarmament deals with the us 
historians argue how great an impact the sdi threat had on the soviets whether it was enough to force gorbachev to initiate radical reforms or whether the deterioration of the soviet economy alone forced the reforms 
there is agreement that the soviets realized they were well behind the americans in military technology that to try to catch up would be very expensive and that the military expenses were already a very heavy burden slowing down their economy 
reagans invasion of grenada and bombing of libya were popular in the us though his backing of the contras rebels was mired in the controversy over the irancontra affair that revealed reagans poor management style 
reagan met four times with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev who ascended to power in NUM and their summit conferences led to the signing of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty 
gorbachev tried to save communism in the soviet union first by ending the expensive arms race with america then by shedding the east european empire in NUM
the soviet union collapsed on christmas day NUM ending the ussoviet cold war 
the united states emerged as the worlds sole remaining superpower and continued to intervene in international affairs during the NUMs including the NUM gulf war against iraq 
following his election in NUM president bill clinton oversaw one of the longest periods of economic expansion and unprecedented gains in securities values a side effect of the digital revolution and new business opportunities created by the internet 
he also worked with the republican congress to pass the first balanced federal budget in NUM years 
in NUM clinton was impeached by the house of representatives on charges of lying about a sexual relationship with white house intern monica lewinsky 
he was acquitted by the senate 
the failure of impeachment and the democratic gains in the NUM election forced house speaker newt gingrich a republican to resign from congress 
the republican party expanded its base throughout the south after NUM excepting NUM largely due to its strength among socially conservative white evangelical protestants and traditionalist roman catholics added to its traditional strength in the business community and suburbs 
as white democrats in the south lost dominance of the democratic party in the NUMs the region took on the two-party apparatus which characterized most of the nation 
the republican partys central leader by NUM was ronald reagan whose conservative policies called for reduced government spending and regulation lower taxes and a strong anti-soviet foreign policy 
his iconic status in the party persists into the NUMst century as practically all republican party leaders acknowledge his stature 
social scientists theodore caplow et al 
argue the republican party nationally moved from right-center toward the center in NUMs and NUMs then moved right again in the NUMs and NUMs 
they add the democratic party nationally moved from left-center toward the center in the NUMs and NUMs then moved further toward the right-center in the NUMs and NUMs 
the presidential election in NUM between george w bush and al gore was one of the closest in us history and helped lay the seeds for political polarization to come 
the vote in the decisive state of florida was extremely close and produced a dramatic dispute over the counting of votes 
the us supreme court in bush v gore ended the recount with a NUM vote 
that meant bush then in the lead carried florida and the election 
including NUM the democrats outpolled the republicans in the national vote in every election from NUM to NUM except for NUM
on september NUM NUM NUM the united states was struck by a terrorist attack when NUM al-qaeda hijackers commandeered four airliners to be used in suicide attacks and intentionally crashed two into both twin towers of the world trade center and the third into the pentagon killing NUM victimsNUM aboard the three airliners NUM who were in the world trade center and on the ground and NUM who were in the pentagon 
the fourth plane was re-taken by the passengers and crew of the aircraft 
while they were not able to land the plane safely they were able to re-take control of the aircraft and crash it into an empty field in pennsylvania killing all NUM people including the four terrorists on board thereby saving whatever target the terrorists were aiming for 
within two hours both twin towers of the world trade center completely collapsed causing massive damage to the surrounding area and blanketing lower manhattan in toxic dust clouds 
all in all a total of NUM victims perished in the attacks 
in response president george w bush on september NUM announced a war on terror
on october NUM NUM the united states and nato then invaded afghanistan to oust the taliban regime which had provided safe haven to al-qaeda and its leader osama bin laden 
the federal government established new domestic efforts to prevent future attacks 
the controversial usa patriot act increased the governments power to monitor communications and removed legal restrictions on information sharing between federal law enforcement and intelligence services 
a cabinet-level agency called the department of homeland security was created to lead and coordinate federal counter-terrorism activities 
some of these anti-terrorism efforts particularly the us governments handling of detainees at the prison at guantanamo bay led to allegations against the us government of human rights violations 
in NUM from march NUM to may NUM the united states launched an invasion of iraq which led to the collapse of the iraq government and the eventual capture of iraqi dictator saddam hussein with whom the us had long-standing tense relations 
the reasons for the invasion cited by the bush administration included the spreading of democracy the elimination of weapons of mass destruction a key demand of the un as well though later investigations found parts of the intelligence reports to be inaccurate and the liberation of the iraqi people 
despite some initial successes early in the invasion the continued iraq war fueled international protests and gradually saw domestic support decline as many people began to question whether or not the invasion was worth the cost

to kill a mockingbird

to kill a mockingbird is a novel by harper lee published in NUM
it was immediately successful winning the pulitzer prize and has become a classic of modern american literature 
the plot and characters are loosely based on lees observations of her family her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of monroeville alabama in NUM when she was NUMyears old 
the story is told by the six-year-old jean louise finch 
the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality 
the narrators father atticus finch has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers 
one critic explains the novels impact by writing in the twentieth century to kill a mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in america and its protagonist atticus finch the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism 
as a southern gothic novel and a bildungsroman the primary themes of to kill a mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence 
scholars have noted that lee also addresses issues of class courage compassion and gender roles in the american deep south 
the book is widely taught in schools in the united states with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice 
despite its themes to kill a mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms often challenged for its use of racial epithets 
reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication 
despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education literary analysis of it is sparse 
author mary mcdonough murphy who collected individual impressions of to kill a mockingbird by several authors and public figures calls the book an astonishing phenomenon
in NUM british librarians ranked the book ahead of the bible as one every adult should read before they die
it was adapted into an academy award-winning film in NUM by director robert mulligan with a screenplay by horton foote 
since NUM a play based on the novel has been performed annually in harper lees hometown 
to kill a mockingbird was lees only published book until go set a watchman an earlier draft of to kill a mockingbird was published on july NUM NUM
lee continued to respond to her works impact until her death in february NUM although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since NUM
born in NUM harper lee grew up in the southern town of monroeville alabama where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer truman capote 
she attended huntingdon college in montgomery NUM and then studied law at the university of alabama NUM
while attending college she wrote for campus literary magazines huntress at huntingdon and the humor magazine rammer jammer at the university of alabama 
at both colleges she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time 
in NUM lee moved to new york city where she worked as a reservation clerk for british overseas airways corporation there she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in monroeville 
hoping to be published lee presented her writing in NUM to a literary agent recommended by capote 
an editor at j 
b lippincott who bought the manuscript advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing 
donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year 
after finishing the first draft and returning it to lippincott the manuscript at that point titled go set a watchman fell into the hands of therese von hohoff torrey known professionally as tay hohoff 
hohoff was impressed the spark of the true writer flashed in every line she would later recount in a corporate history of lippincott but as hohoff saw it the manuscript was by no means fit for publication 
it was as she described it more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel 
during the following two and a half years she led lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form 
after the watchman title was rejected it was re-titled atticus but lee renamed it to kill a mockingbird to reflect that the story went beyond a character portrait 
the book was published on july NUM NUM
the editorial team at lippincott warned lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies 
in NUM lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said i never expected any sort of success with mockingbird 
...i was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but at the same time i sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement 
public encouragement 
i hoped for a little as i said but i got rather a whole lot and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick merciful death id expected 
instead of a quick and merciful death readers digest condensed books chose the book for reprinting in part which gave it a wide readership immediately 
since the original publication the book has never been out of print 
the story takes place during three years NUM of the great depression in the fictional tired old town of maycomb alabama the seat of maycomb county 
it focuses on six-year-old jean louise finch nicknamed scout who lives with her older brother jeremy nicknamed jem and their widowed father atticus a middle-aged lawyer 
jem and scout befriend a boy named dill who visits maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer 
the three children are terrified yet fascinated by their neighbor the reclusive arthur boo radley 
the adults of maycomb are hesitant to talk about boo and few of them have seen him for many years 
the children feed one anothers imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house 
after two summers of friendship with dill scout and jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the radley place 
several times the mysterious boo makes gestures of affection to the children but to their disappointment he never appears in person 
judge taylor appoints atticus to defend tom robinson a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman mayella ewell 
although many of maycombs citizens disapprove atticus agrees to defend tom to the best of his ability 
other children taunt jem and scout for atticuss actions calling him a nigger-lover
scout is tempted to stand up for her fathers honor by fighting even though he has told her not to 
atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching tom 
this danger is averted when scout jem and dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from atticus and toms perspective 
atticus does not want jem and scout to be present at tom robinsons trial 
no seat is available on the main floor so by invitation of the rev 
sykes jem scout and dill watch from the colored balcony 
atticus establishes that the accusersmayella and her father bob ewell the town drunkare lying 
it also becomes clear that the friendless mayella made sexual advances toward tom and that her father caught her and beat her 
despite significant evidence of toms innocence the jury convicts him 
jems faith in justice becomes badly shaken as is atticus when the hapless tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison 
despite toms conviction bob ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial atticus explaining that he destroyed ewells last shred of credibility at that trial 
ewell vows revenge spitting in atticus face trying to break into the judges house and menacing tom robinsons widow 
finally he attacks the defenseless jem and scout while they walk home on a dark night after the school halloween pageant 
jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle but amid the confusion someone comes to the childrens rescue 
the mysterious man carries jem home where scout realizes that he is boo radley 
sheriff tate arrives and discovers that bob ewell has died during the fight 
the sheriff argues with atticus about the prudence and ethics of charging jem whom atticus believes to be responsible or boo whom tate believes to be responsible
atticus eventually accepts the sheriffs story that ewell simply fell on his own knife 
boo asks scout to walk him home and after she says goodbye to him at his front door he disappears again 
while standing on the radley porch scout imagines life from boos perspective and regrets that they had never repaid him for the gifts he had given them 
scout then goes back home to atticus and stays up with him for a while in jems room 
soon atticus takes her to bed and tucks her in before leaving to go back to jem 
lee has said that to kill a mockingbird is not an autobiography but rather an example of how an author should write about what he knows and write truthfully
nevertheless several people and events from lees childhood parallel those of the fictional scout 
lees father amasa coleman lee was an attorney similar to atticus finch and in NUM he defended two black men accused of murder 
after they were convicted hanged and mutilated he never tried another criminal case 
lees father was also the editor and publisher of the monroeville newspaper 
although more of a proponent of racial segregation than atticus he gradually became more liberal in his later years 
though scouts mother died when she was a baby lee was NUM when her mother frances cunningham finch died 
lees mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent 
lees older brother edwin was the inspiration for jem 
lee modeled the character of dill on her childhood friend truman capote known then as truman persons 
just as dill lived next door to scout during the summer capote lived next door to lee with his aunts while his mother visited new york city 
like dill capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories 
both lee and capote were atypical children both loved to read 
lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight but capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp 
she and capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old underwood typewriter that lees father gave them 
they became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers capote called the two of them apart people
in NUM capote and lee traveled to kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for capotes nonfiction novel in cold blood
down the street from the lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up they served as the models for the fictional radleys 
the son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for NUMyears out of shame 
he was hidden until virtually forgotten he died in NUM
the origin of tom robinson is less clear although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models 
when lee was NUMyears old a white woman near monroeville accused a black man named walter lett of raping her 
the story and the trial were covered by her fathers newspaper which reported that lett was convicted and sentenced to death 
after a series of letters appeared claiming lett had been falsely accused his sentence was commuted to life in prison 
he died there of tuberculosis in NUM
scholars believe that robinsons difficulties reflect the notorious case of the scottsboro boys in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence 
however in NUM lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational although the scottsboro case served the same purpose to display southern prejudices 
emmett till a black teenager who was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman in mississippi in NUM and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the civil rights movement is also considered a model for tom robinson 
the strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is lees talent for narration which in an early review in time was called tactile brilliance
writing a decade later another scholar noted harper lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling 
her art is visual and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition 
lee combines the narrators voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown womans reflecting on her childhood using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives 
this narrative method allows lee to tell a delightfully deceptive story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition 
however at times the blending causes reviewers to question scouts preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding 
both harding lemay and the novelist and literary critic granville hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as scout and jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for tom robinsons life 
writing about lees style and use of humor in a tragic story scholar jacqueline tavernier-courbin states laughter .. exposes the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it one can hardly .. be controlled by what one is able to laugh at 
scouts precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired national endowment of the arts director david kipen to call her hysterically funny
to address complex issues however tavernier-courbin notes that lee uses parody satire and irony effectively by using a childs perspective 
after dill promises to marry her then spends too much time with jem scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up which she does several times 
scouts first day in school is a satirical treatment of education her teacher says she must undo the damage atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write and forbids atticus from teaching her further 
lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony however as jem and scout try to understand how maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society 
satire and irony are used to such an extent that tavernier-courbin suggests one interpretation for the books title lee is doing the mockingof education the justice system and her own societyby using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval 
critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot 
when atticus is out of town jem locks a sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of shadrach 
this prompts their black housekeeper calpurnia to escort scout and jem to her church which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life as well as tom robinsons 
scout falls asleep during the halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage causing the audience to laugh uproariously 
she is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume which saves her life 
scholars have characterized to kill a mockingbird as both a southern gothic and a bildungsroman
the grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of boo radley and his house and the element of racial injustice involving tom robinson contribute to the aura of the gothic in the novel 
lee used the term gothic to describe the architecture of maycombs courthouse and in regard to dills exaggeratedly morbid performances as boo radley 
outsiders are also an important element of southern gothic texts and scout and jems questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to catcher in the rye and adventures of huckleberry finn
despite challenging the towns systems scout reveres atticus as an authority above all others because he believes that following ones conscience is the highest priority even when the result is social ostracism 
however scholars debate about the southern gothic classification noting that boo radley is in fact human protective and benevolent 
furthermore in addressing themes such as alcoholism incest rape and racial violence lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically 
she portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society 
as children coming of age scout and jem face hard realities and learn from them 
lee seems to examine jems sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than scouts 
jem says to their neighbor miss maudie the day after the trial its like bein a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon .
i always thought maycomb folks were the best folks in the world least thats what they seemed like
this leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class 
just as the novel is an illustration of the changes jem faces it is also an exploration of the realities scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood 
as one scholar writes to kill a mockingbird can be read as a feminist bildungsroman for scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be 
despite the novels immense popularity upon publication it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern american classics 
don noble editor of a book of essays about the novel estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one 
christopher metress writes that the book is an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined
noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller if that many people like it it cant be any good 
and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation 
harper lee has remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-NUMs 
however she gave some insight into her themes when in a rare letter to the editor she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that to kill a mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct christian in its ethic that is the heritage of all southerners 
when the book was released reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts and opinion was mixed about lees ability to connect them 
the first part of the novel concerns the childrens fascination with boo radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood 
reviewers were generally charmed by scout and jems observations of their quirky neighbors 
one writer was so impressed by lees detailed explanations of the people of maycomb that he categorized the book as southern romantic regionalism 
this sentimentalism can be seen in lees representation of the southern caste system to explain almost every characters behavior in the novel 
scouts aunt alexandra attributes maycombs inhabitants faults and advantages to genealogy families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the finch family history and the history of maycomb 
this regionalist theme is further reflected in mayella ewells apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward tom robinson and scouts definition of fine folks being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have 
the south itself with its traditions and taboos seems to drive the plot more than the characters 
the second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer harding lemay termed the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white southerner in the treatment of the negro
in the years following its release many reviewers considered to kill a mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations 
claudia durst johnson considers it reasonable to believe that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in alabama rosa parks refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person which sparked the NUM montgomery bus boycott and the NUM riots at the university of alabama after autherine lucy and polly myers were admitted myers eventually withdrew her application and lucy was expelled but reinstated in NUM
in writing about the historical context of the novels construction two other literary scholars remark to kill a mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the south since the civil war and reconstruction 
inevitably despite its mid-NUMs setting the story told from the perspective of the NUMs voices the conflicts tensions and fears induced by this transition 
scholar patrick chura who suggests emmett till was a model for tom robinson enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional tom that till also faced 
chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the mythologized vulnerable and sacred southern womanhood
any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused 
tom robinsons trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jurys decision 
furthermore the victim of racial injustice in to kill a mockingbird was physically impaired which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of but also crippled him in other ways 
roslyn siegel includes tom robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white southern writers of the black man as stupid pathetic defenseless and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites rather than his own intelligence to save him
although tom is spared from being lynched he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison being shot seventeen times 
the theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well 
for example atticus must shoot a rabid dog even though it is not his job to do so 
carolyn jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of maycomb and atticus who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog must fight against the towns racism without help from other white citizens 
he is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch tom robinson and once more in the courthouse during toms trial 
lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes 
jones writes the real mad dog in maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of tom robinson .
when atticus makes his summation to the jury he literally bares himself to the jurys and the towns anger 
in a NUM interview lee remarked that her aspiration was to be .. the jane austen of south alabama 
both austen and lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing 
when scout embarrasses her poorer classmate walter cunningham at the finch home one day calpurnia their black cook chastises and punishes her for doing so 
atticus respects calpurnias judgment and later in the book even stands up to his sister the formidable aunt alexandra when she strongly suggests they fire calpurnia 
one writer notes that scout in austenian fashion satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify 
literary critic jean blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors affirmation of order in society obedience courtesy and respect for the individual without regard for status
scholars argue that lees approach to class and race was more complex than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to poor white trash... lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice silence the voices that might challenge the existing order and greatly complicate many americans conception of the causes of racism and segregation 
lees use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader regardless of class or cultural background and fosters a sense of nostalgia 
sharing scout and jems perspective the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum mrs dubose the lower-class ewells and the cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways the wealthy but ostracized mr dolphus raymond and calpurnia and other members of the black community 
the children internalize atticus admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that persons skin gaining a greater understanding of peoples motives and behavior 
the novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage 
scouts impulsive inclination to fight students who insult atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him 
atticus is the moral center of the novel however and he teaches jem one of the most significant lessons of courage 
in a statement that both foreshadows atticus motivation for defending tom robinson and describes mrs dubose who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction atticus tells jem that courage is when youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what
charles j shields who wrote the first book-length biography of harper lee offers the reason for the novels enduring popularity and impact is that its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal
atticus lesson to scout that you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of viewuntil you climb around in his skin and walk around in it exemplifies his compassion 
she ponders the comment when listening to mayella ewells testimony 
when mayella reacts with confusion to atticus question if she has any friends scout offers that she must be lonelier than boo radley 
having walked boo home after he saves their lives scout stands on the radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from boos perspective 
one writer remarks ...while the novel concerns tragedy and injustice heartache and loss it also carries with it a strong sense of courage compassion and an awareness of history to be better human beings 
just as lee explores jems development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society scout realizes what being female means and several female characters influence her development 
scouts primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider 
scouts primary female models are calpurnia and her neighbor miss maudie both of whom are strong-willed independent and protective 
mayella ewell also has an influence scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him 
the female characters who comment the most on scouts lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view 
for example mrs dubose chastises scout for not wearing a dress and camisole and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so in addition to insulting atticus intentions to defend tom robinson 
by balancing the masculine influences of atticus and jem with the feminine influences of calpurnia and miss maudie one scholar writes lee gradually demonstrates that scout is becoming a feminist in the south for with the use of first-person narration she indicates that scout jean louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a southern lady she possessed as a child 
absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel 
scout and jems mother died before scout could remember her mayellas mother is dead and mrs radley is silent about boos confinement to the house 
apart from atticus the fathers described are abusers 
bob ewell it is hinted molested his daughter and mr radley imprisons his son in his house to the extent that boo is remembered only as a phantom 
bob ewell and mr radley represent a form of masculinity that atticus does not and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the missionary society can lead society astray 
atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity as one scholar explains it is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism bravery and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality to set the society straight 
allusions to legal issues in to kill a mockingbird particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom have drawn the attention of legal scholars 
claudia durst johnson writes that a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals
the opening quote by the NUMth-century essayist charles lamb reads lawyers i suppose were children once 
johnson notes that even in scout and jems childhood world compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on ones palm and laws are discussed by atticus and his children is it right that bob ewell hunts and traps out of season
many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms mr dolphus raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children mayella ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing tom robinson by being turned into a non-person boo radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him 
scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them 
for example she refuses to wear frilly clothes saying that aunt alexandras fanatical attempts to place her in them made her feel a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on her
johnson states the novel is a study of how jem and scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of their small worlds 
songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel 
their family name finch is also lees mothers maiden name 
the titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme which first appears when atticus having given his children air-rifles for christmas allows their uncle jack to teach them to shoot 
atticus warns them that although they can shoot all the bluejays they want they must remember that its a sin to kill a mockingbird
confused scout approaches her neighbor miss maudie who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures 
she points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs saying they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us 
writer edwin bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in NUM to kill a mockingbird is to kill that which is innocent and harmlesslike tom robinson 
scholars have noted that lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point 
tom robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel 
however scholar christopher metress connects the mockingbird to boo radley instead of wanting to exploit boo for her own fun as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history scout comes to see him as a mockingbirdthat is as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished 
the last pages of the book illustrate this as scout relates the moral of a story atticus has been reading to her and in allusions to both boo radley and tom robinson states about a character who was misunderstood when they finally saw him why he hadnt done any of those things .. atticus he was real nice to which he responds most people are scout when you finally see them 
the novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer r a dave claims that because every character has to face or even suffer defeat the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy 
in exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools 
she guides the reader in such judgments alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony 
scouts experience with the missionary society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her gossip and reflect a smug colonialist attitude toward other races while giving the appearance of gentility piety and morality
conversely when atticus loses toms case he is last to leave the courtroom except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony who rise silently as he walks underneath them to honor his efforts 
despite her editors warnings that the book might not sell well it quickly became a sensation bringing acclaim to lee in literary circles in her hometown of monroeville and throughout alabama 
the book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in the book of the month club and editions released by readers digest condensed books
initial reactions to the novel were varied 
the new yorker declared lee a skilled unpretentious and totally ingenuous writer and the atlantic monthlynowikinowikis reviewer rated the book pleasant undemanding reading but found the narrative voicea six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adultto be implausible 
time magazines NUM review of the book states that it teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about southern life and calls scout finch the most appealing child since carson mccullers frankie got left behind at the wedding
the chicago sunday tribune noted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novels events writing this is in no way a sociological novel 
it underlines no cause .. to kill a mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance 
not all reviewers were enthusiastic 
some lamented the use of poor white southerners and one-dimensional black victims and granville hicks labeled the book melodramatic and contrived
when the book was first released southern writer flannery oconnor commented i think for a childs book it does all right 
its interesting that all the folks that are buying it dont know theyre reading a childs book 
somebody ought to say what it is 
carson mccullers apparently agreed with the time magazine review writing to a cousin well honey one thing we know is that shes been poaching on my literary preserves 
one year after its publication to kill a mockingbird had been translated into ten languages 
in the years since it has sold more than NUMmillion copies and been translated into more than NUM languages 
the novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback and has become part of the standard literature curriculum 
a NUM survey of secondary books read by students between grades NUM in the us indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades 
a NUM survey by the book of the month club and the library of congress center for the book found that to kill a mockingbird was rated behind only the bible in books that are most often cited as making a difference
it is considered by some to be the great american novel
the NUMth anniversary of the novels release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact 
eric zorn of the chicago tribune praises lees rich use of language but writes that the central lesson is that courage isnt always flashy isnt always enough but is always in style
jane sullivan in the sydney morning herald agrees stating that the book still rouses fresh and horrified indignation as it examines morality a topic that has recently become unfashionable 
chimamanda ngozi adichie writing in the guardian states that lee rare among american novelists writes with a fiercely progressive ink in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question comparing her to william faulkner who wrote about racism as an inevitability 
literary critic rosemary goring in scotlands the herald notes the connections between lee and jane austen stating the books central theme that ones moral convictions are worth fighting for even at the risk of being reviled is eloquently discussed 
native alabamian sports writer allen barra sharply criticized lee and the novel in the wall street journal calling atticus a repository of cracker-barrel epigrams and the novel represents a sugar-coated myth of alabama history 
barra writes its time to stop pretending that to kill a mockingbird is some kind of timeless classic that ranks with the great works of american literature 
its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated
thomas mallon in the new yorker criticizes atticus stiff and self-righteous demeanor and calls scout a kind of highly constructed doll whose speech and actions are improbable 
although acknowledging that the novel works mallon blasts lees wildly unstable narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama following with his observation that the book has begun to cherish its own goodness by the time the case is over 
defending the book akin ajayi writes that justice is often complicated but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all 
ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race class and society but that it was not written to resolve them 
many writers compare their perceptions of to kill a mockingbird as adults with when they first read it as children 
mary mcdonagh murphy interviewed celebrities including oprah winfrey rosanne cash tom brokaw and harpers sister alice lee who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled scout atticus and boo
one of the most significant impacts to kill a mockingbird has had is atticus finchs model of integrity for the legal profession 
as scholar alice petry explains atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person 
morris dees of the southern poverty law center cites atticus finch as the reason he became a lawyer and richard matsch the federal judge who presided over the timothy mcveigh trial counts atticus as a major judicial influence 
one law professor at the university of notre dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was to kill a mockingbird and an article in the michigan law review claims no real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession before questioning whether atticus finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun
in NUM an alabama editorial called for the death of atticus saying that as liberal as atticus was he still worked within a system of institutionalized racism and sexism and should not be revered 
the editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero 
critics of atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in maycomb 
however in NUM the alabama state bar erected a monument to atticus in monroeville marking his existence as the first commemorative milestone in the states judicial history
in NUM lee herself received an honorary special membership to the alabama state bar for creating atticus who has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor
to kill a mockingbird has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as NUM
the books racial slurs profanity and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the united states 
the american library association reported that to kill a mockingbird was number NUM of the NUM most frequently challenged books of NUM
following parental complaints about the racist language it contains the novel was removed from classrooms in virginia in NUM and biloxi in NUM where it was described as making people uncomfortable 
in the mississippi case the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent 
such decisions have been criticised the american civil liberties union noted the importance of engaging with the novels themes in places where racial injustice persists 
becky little of the history channel and representatives of the mark twain house pointed out the value of classics lies in their power to challenge the way we think about things twains adventures of huckleberry finn has attracted similar controversy
arne duncan who served as secretary of education under president obama noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with real problems 
in NUM a parent in hanover virginia protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral 
johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers which ranged from amusement to fury those letters expressing the most outrage however complained about mayella ewells attraction to tom robinson over the depictions of rape 
upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the books appropriateness for the classroom harper lee sent NUM to the richmond news leader suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of the hanover county school board in any first grade of its choice
the national education association in NUM placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizationsafter little black sambo
with a shift of attitudes about race in the NUMs to kill a mockingbird faced challenges of a different sort the treatment of racism in maycomb was not condemned harshly enough 
this has led to disparate perceptions that the novel has a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers but a more ambiguous reception by black readers 
in one high-profile case outside the us  school districts in the canadian provinces of new brunswick and nova scotia attempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula in the NUMs stating

furthermore despite the novels thematic focus on racial injustice its black characters are not fully examined 
in its use of racial epithets stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks and calpurnia who to some critics is an updated version of the contented slave motif and to others simply unexplored the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters 
one writer asserts that the use of scouts narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict 
scouts voice functions as the not-me which allows the rest of usblack and white male and femaleto find our relative position in society
a teaching guide for the novel published by the english journal cautions what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another
a canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students but that black students found it demoralizing
another criticism articulated by michael lind is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural white trash
the novel is cited as a factor in the success of the civil rights movement in the NUMs however in that it arrived at the right moment to help the south and the nation grapple with the racial tensions of the accelerating civil rights movement
its publication is so closely associated with the civil rights movement that many studies of the book and biographies of harper lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them 
civil rights leader andrew young comments that part of the books effectiveness is that it inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set 
young views the novel as an act of humanity in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices 
alabama author mark childress compares it to the impact of uncle toms cabin a book that is popularly implicated in starting the us civil war 
childress states the novel gives white southerners a way to understand the racism that theyve been brought up with and to find another way 
and most white people in the south were good people 
most white people in the south were not throwing bombs and causing havoc .
i think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do because it was popular art because it was told from a childs point of view 
diane mcwhorter pulitzer prize-winning historian of the birmingham civil rights campaign asserts that to kill a mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists and states that every child in the south has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality 
this feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised which for many children is what the novel does 
mcwhorter writes of lee for a white person from the south to write a book like this in the late NUMs is really unusualby its very existence an act of protest 
author james mcbride calls lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave i think by calling harper lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism .. she certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed but in many ways i feel .. the moral bars been lowered 
and thats really distressing 
we need a thousand atticus finches 
mcbride however defends the books sentimentality and the way lee approaches the story with honesty and integrity
during the years immediately following the novels publication harper lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her granting interviews visiting schools and attending events honoring the book 
in NUM when to kill a mockingbird was in its NUMst week on the bestseller list it was awarded the pulitzer prize stunning lee 
it also won the brotherhood award of the national conference of christians and jews in the same year and the paperback of the year award from bestsellers magazine in NUM
starting in NUM lee began to turn down interviews complaining that the questions were monotonous and grew concerned that attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought 
since then she declined talking with reporters about the book 
she also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction writing in NUM introductions inhibit pleasure they kill the joy of anticipation they frustrate curiosity 
the only good thing about introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come 
mockingbird still says what it has to say it has managed to survive the years without preamble 
in NUM lee was inducted into the alabama academy of honor 
in the same year chicago mayor richard m daley initiated a reading program throughout the citys libraries and chose his favorite book to kill a mockingbird as the first title of the one city one book program 
lee declared that there is no greater honor the novel could receive
by NUM the novel had been chosen by NUMcommunities for variations of the citywide reading program more than any other novel 
david kipen of the national endowment of the arts who supervised the big read states people just seem to connect with it 
it dredges up things in their own lives their interactions across racial lines legal encounters and childhood 
its just this skeleton key to so many different parts of peoples lives and they cherish it 
in NUM lee was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university of notre dame 
during the ceremony the students and audience gave lee a standing ovation and the entire graduating class held up copies of to kill a mockingbird to honor her 
lee was awarded the presidential medal of freedom on november NUM NUM by president george w bush 
in his remarks bush stated one reason to kill a mockingbird succeeded is the wise and kind heart of the author which comes through on every page .. to kill a mockingbird has influenced the character of our country for the better 
its been a gift to the entire world 
as a model of good writing and humane sensibility this book will be read and studied forever 
the book was made into the well-received NUM film with the same title starring gregory peck as atticus finch 
the films producer alan j pakula remembered universal pictures executives questioning him about a potential script they said what story do you plan to tell for the film
i said have you read the book
they said yes 
i said thats the story 
the movie was a hit at the box office quickly grossing more than NUM million from a NUM-million budget 
it won three oscars best actor for gregory peck best art direction-set decoration black-and-white and best writing screenplay based on material from another medium for horton foote 
it was nominated for five more oscars including best actress in a supporting role for mary badham the actress who played scout 
harper lee was pleased with the movie saying in that film the man and the part met .
ive had many many offers to turn it into musicals into tv or stage plays but ive always refused 
that film was a work of art 
peck met lees father the model for atticus before the filming 
lees father died before the films release 
lee was so impressed with pecks performance that she gave him her fathers pocket watch which he had with him the evening he was awarded the oscar for best actor 
years later he was reluctant to tell lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in london heathrow airport 
when peck eventually did tell lee he said she responded well its only a watch 
harpershe feels deeply but shes not a sentimental person about things 
lee and peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made 
pecks grandson was named harper in her honor 
in may NUM lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the los angeles public library at the request of pecks widow veronique who said of lee shes like a national treasure 
shes someone who has made a difference ..with this book 
the book is still as strong as it ever was and so is the film 
all the kids in the united states read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays 
my husband used to get thousands and thousands of letters from teachers who would send them to him 
the book has also been adapted as a play by christopher sergel 
it debuted in NUM in monroeville a town that labels itself the literary capital of alabama
the play runs every may on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast 
white male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury 
during the courtroom scene the production moves into the monroe county courthouse and the audience is racially segregated 
author albert murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel and the annual performance it becomes part of the town ritual like the religious underpinning of mardi gras 
with the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse its part of a central civic educationwhat monroeville aspires to be 
sergels play toured in the uk starting at west yorkshire playhouse in leeds in NUM and again in NUM starting at the york theatre royal both productions featuring duncan preston as atticus finch 
the play also opened the NUM season at regents park open air theatre in london where it played to full houses and starred robert sean leonard as atticus finch his first london appearance in NUM years 
the production returned to the venue to close the NUM season prior to a uk tour 
according to a national geographic article the novel is so revered in monroeville that people quote lines from it like scripture yet harper lee herself refused to attend any performances because she abhors anything that trades on the books fame
to underscore this sentiment lee demanded that a book of recipes named calpurnias cookbook not be published and sold out of the monroe county heritage museum 
david lister in the independent states that lees refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more and her silence makes bob dylan look like a media tart
despite her discouragement a rising number of tourists made monroeville their destination hoping to see lees inspiration for the book or lee herself 
local residents call them mockingbird groupies and although lee was not reclusive she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic hell no
an earlier draft of to kill a mockingbird titled go set a watchman was controversially released on july NUM NUM
this draft which was completed in NUM is set NUM years after the time period depicted in to kill a mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative 
this earlier version of the story follows an adult scout finch who travels from new york city to visit her father atticus finch in maycomb alabama where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community 
the watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until lees lawyer tonja carter discovered it but this claim has been widely disputed 
watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from to kill a mockingbird
according to lees agent andrew nurnberg mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy they discussed publishing mockingbird first watchman last and a shorter connecting novel between the two 
this assertion has been discredited however by rare-books expert james s jaffe who reviewed the pages at the request of lees attorney and found them to be only another draft of to kill a mockingbird
nurnbergs statement was also contrary to jonathan mahlers description of how watchman was seen as just the first draft of mockingbird
instances where many passages overlap between the two books in some case word for word also refutes this assertion 
the great gatsby

the great gatsby is a NUM novel written by american author f scott fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of west and east egg on prosperous long island in the summer of NUM
the story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire jay gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante daisy buchanan 
considered to be fitzgeralds magnum opus the great gatsby explores themes of decadence idealism resistance to change social upheaval and excess creating a portrait of the jazz age or the roaring twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the american dream 
fitzgeraldinspired by the parties he had attended while visiting long islands north shorebegan planning the novel in NUM desiring to produce in his words something newsomething extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned 
progress was slow with fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the french riviera in NUM
his editor maxwell perkins felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter 
fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the books title and he considered a variety of alternatives including titles that referenced the roman character trimalchio the title he was last documented to have desired was under the red white and blue 
first published by scribners in april NUM the great gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly in its first year the book sold only NUM copies 
fitzgerald died in NUM believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten 
however the novel experienced a revival during world war ii and became a part of american high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades 
today the great gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title great american novel 
in NUM the modern library editorial board voted it the NUMth centurys best american novel and second best english-language novel of the same time period 
set on the prosperous long island of NUM the great gatsby provides a critical social history of america during the roaring twenties within its fictional narrative 
that era known for profound economic prosperity the development of jazz music flapper culture new technologies in communication motion pictures broadcast radio recorded music forging a genuine mass culture and bootlegging along with other criminal activity is plausibly depicted in fitzgeralds novel 
fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the NUMs that were to build gatsbys stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like fitzgeralds discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of gatsbys fortune 
fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the roaring twenties by placing the books plotline within the historical context of the era 
fitzgeralds visits to long islands north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired the great gatsbys setting 
today there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book 
one possibility is lands end a notable gold coast mansion where fitzgerald may have attended a party 
many of the events in fitzgeralds early life are reflected throughout the great gatsby
fitzgerald was a young man from minnesota and like nick he was educated at an ivy league school princeton in nicks case yale
fitzgerald is also similar to jay gatsby in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved 
fitzgerald became a second lieutenant and was stationed at camp sheridan in montgomery alabama 
there he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named zelda sayre 
zelda finally agreed to marry him but her preference for wealth fun and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success 
like nick in the great gatsby fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting and like gatsby he had always idolized the very rich 
in many ways the great gatsby represents fitzgeralds attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the jazz age 
like gatsby fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted even as she led him toward everything he despised 
in her book careless people murder mayhem and the invention of the great gatsby NUM sarah churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of the great gatsby were based on the hall-mills case 
based on her forensic search for clues she asserts that the two victims in the hall-mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in the great gatsby
in the summer of NUM nick carraway a yale graduate and veteran of the great war from the midwestwho serves as the novels narratortakes a job in new york as a bond salesman 
he rents a small house on long island in the fictional village of west egg next door to the lavish mansion of jay gatsby a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them 
nick drives around the bay to east egg for dinner at the home of his cousin daisy fay buchanan and her husband tom a college acquaintance of nicks 
they introduce nick to jordan baker an attractive cynical young golfer 
she reveals to nick that tom has a mistress myrtle wilson who lives in the valley of ashes an industrial dumping ground between west egg and new york city 
not long after this revelation nick travels to new york city with tom and myrtle to an apartment where tom keeps his affairs with myrtle and others 
at toms new york apartment a vulgar and bizarre party takes place 
it ends with tom breaking myrtles nose after she annoys him by saying daisys name several times 
nick eventually receives an invitation to one of gatsbys parties 
nick encounters jordan baker at the party and they meet gatsby himself an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes nick from their same division in the great war 
through jordan nick later learns that gatsby knew daisy through a purely chance meeting in NUM when daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services work with young officers headed to europe 
from their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time gatsby became and still is deeply in love with daisy 
gatsby had hoped that his wild parties would attract an unsuspecting daisy who lived across the bay to appear at his doorstep and allow him to present himself as a man of wealth and position 
having developed a budding friendship with nick gatsby uses him to arrange a reunion between himself and daisy 
nick invites daisy to have tea at his house without telling her that gatsby will also be there 
after an initially awkward reunion gatsby and daisy begin an affair over the summer 
at a luncheon at the buchanans house daisy speaks to gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that tom realizes she is in love with gatsby 
though tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair he is outraged by his wifes infidelity 
he forces the group to drive into new york city and confronts gatsby in a suite at the plaza hotel asserting that he and daisy have a history that gatsby could never understand 
in addition to that he announces to his wife that gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities 
daisy realizes that her allegiance is to tom and tom contemptuously sends her back to east egg with gatsby attempting to prove that gatsby cannot hurt her 
on the way back gatsbys car strikes and kills toms mistress myrtle 
nick later learns from gatsby that daisy not gatsby himself was driving the car at the time of the accident 
myrtles husband george wilson falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he suspects she has 
he learns that the yellow car is gatsbys fatally shoots him and then turns the gun on himself 
nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for gatsby which none of gatsbys associates or partygoers attend 
later nick runs into tom in new york and finds out that tom had told george that the yellow car was gatsbys and gave him gatsbys address 
disillusioned with the east nick moves back to the midwest 
fitzgerald began planning his third novel in june NUM but it was interrupted by production of his play the vegetable in the summer and fall 
the play failed miserably and fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production 
the stories were in his words all trash and it nearly broke my heart although included among those stories was winter dreams which fitzgerald later described as a sort of first draft of the gatsby idea
after the birth of their child the fitzgeralds moved to great neck new york on long island in october NUM
the town was used as the scene of the great gatsby
fitzgeralds neighbors in great neck included such prominent and newly wealthy new yorkers as writer ring lardner actor lew fields and comedian ed wynn 
these figures were all considered to be new money unlike those who came from manhasset neck or cow neck peninsula places which were home to many of new yorks wealthiest established families and which sat across the bay from great neck 
this real-life juxtaposition gave fitzgerald his idea for west egg and east egg
in this novel great neck kings point became the new money peninsula of west egg and port washington sands point the old-money east egg 
several mansions in the area served as inspiration for gatsbys home such as oheka castle and beacon towers since demolished 
by mid-NUM fitzgerald had written NUM words for his novel but discarded most of his new story as a false start some of which resurfaced in the NUM short story absolution
work on the great gatsby began in earnest in april NUM
fitzgerald wrote in his ledger out of woods at last and starting novel 
he decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told perkins that the novel was to be a consciously artistic achievement and a purely creative worknot trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world 
he added later during editing that he felt an enormous power in me now more than ive ever had 
soon after this burst of inspiration work slowed while the fitzgeralds made a move to the french riviera where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed 
by august however fitzgerald was hard at work and completed what he believed to be his final manuscript in october sending the book to his editor maxwell perkins and agent harold ober on october NUM
the fitzgeralds then moved to rome for the winter 
fitzgerald made revisions through the winter after perkins informed him in a november letter that the character of gatsby was somewhat vague and gatsbys wealth and business respectively needed the suggestion of an explanation and should be adumbrated
content after a few rounds of revision fitzgerald returned the final batch of revised galleys in the middle of february NUM
fitzgeralds revisions included an extensive rewriting of chapter vi and viii 
despite this he refused an offer of NUM for the serial rights in order not to delay the books publication 
he had received a NUM advance in NUM and NUM.NUM upon publication 
the cover of the first printing of the great gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in american literature 
it depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline with images of naked women reflected in the irises 
a little-known artist named francis cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it 
the cover was completed before the novel fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had written it into the novel 
fitzgeralds remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist dr t j eckleburg depicted on a faded commercial billboard near george wilsons auto repair shop which fitzgerald described as blue and gigantic their retinas are one yard high 
they look out of no face but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose 
although this passage has some resemblance to the painting a closer explanation can be found in the description of daisy buchanan as the girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs 
ernest hemingway wrote in a moveable feast that when fitzgerald lent him a copy of the great gatsby to read he immediately disliked the cover but scott told me not to be put off by it that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in long island that was important in the story 
he said he had liked the jacket and now he didnt like it 
fitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly choosing the great gatsby a title inspired by alain-fourniers le grand meaulnes
prior fitzgerald shifted between gatsby among ash-heaps and millionaires trimalchio trimalchio in west egg on the road to west egg under the red white and blue gold-hatted gatsby and the high-bouncing lover
the titles the gold-hatted gatsby and the high-bouncing lover came from fitzgeralds epigraph for the novel one which he wrote himself under the pen name of thomas parke dinvilliers 
he initially preferred titles referencing trimalchio the crude parvenu in petronius satyricon and even refers to gatsby as trimalchio once in the novel it was when curiosity about gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one saturday nightand as obscurely as it had begun his career as trimalchio was over 
unlike gatsbys spectacular parties trimalchio participated in the audacious and libidinous orgies he hosted but according to tony tanners introduction to the penguin edition there are subtle similarities between the two 
in november NUM fitzgerald wrote to perkins that i have now decided to stick to the title i put on the book .. trimalchio in west egg but was eventually persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people would not be able to pronounce it 
his wife zelda and perkins both expressed their preference for the great gatsby and the next month fitzgerald agreed 
a month before publication after a final review of the proofs he asked if it would be possible to re-title it trimalchio or gold-hatted gatsby but perkins advised against it 
on march NUM NUM fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title under the red white and blue but it was at that stage too late to change 
the great gatsby was published on april NUM NUM
fitzgerald remarked that the title is only fair rather bad than good 
early drafts of the novel entitled trimalchio an early version of the great gatsby have been published 
a notable difference between the trimalchio draft and the great gatsby is a less complete failure of gatsbys dream in trimalchio
another difference is that the argument between tom buchanan and jay gatsby is more even although daisy still returns to tom 
sarah churchwell sees the great gatsby as a cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the american dream 
the story deals with the limits and realities of americas ideals of social and class mobility and the inevitably hopeless lower class aspirations to rise above the stations of their birth 
the book in stark relief through the narrator nick carraway observes that ...a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth 
using elements of irony and tragic ending it also delves into themes of excesses of the rich and recklessness of youth 
others like journalist nick gillespie see the great gatsby as a story underlying permanence of class differences even in the face of a modern economys attempt to assert that the class structure is based not on status and inherited position but upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers needs 
this interpretation asserts that the great gatsby captures the american experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants southern europeans in the early NUMth century latin americans today the nouveau riche or successful minorities americans from the NUMs to the NUMst century have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances 
as gillespie states while the specific terms of the equation are always changing its easy to see echoes of gatsbys basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of american society 
because this concept is particularly american and can be seen throughout american history readers are able to relate to the great gatsby which has lent the novel an enduring popularity
later critical writings on the great gatsby following the novels revival focus in particular on fitzgeralds disillusionment with the american dream life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the context of the hedonistic jazz age a name for the era which fitzgerald claimed to have coined 
in NUM roger pearson published the article gatsby false prophet of the american dream in which he states that fitzgerald has come to be associated with this concept of the american dream more than any other writer of the twentieth century
pearson goes on to suggest that gatsbys failure to realize the american dream demonstrates that it no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as gatsby 
he concludes that the american dream pursued by gatsby is in reality a nightmare bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize its unsustainability and ultimately its unattainability 
in addition to exploring the trials and tribulations of achieving the great american dream during the jazz age the great gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme exemplifying in daisy buchanans character the marginalization of women in the east egg social class that fitzgerald depicts 
as an upper-class white woman living in east egg during this time period in america daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife mother keeper of the house and charming socialite 
as the reader finds in the novel many of daisys choices ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a beautiful little fool who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security 
for instance one could argue that daisys ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for gatsby can be attributed to the status security and comfort that her marriage to tom buchanan provides 
additionally the theme of the female familial role within the great gatsby goes hand in hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great american dream- a dream that goes unrealized for gatsby and daisy in fitzgeralds prose 
the great gatsby was published by charles scribners sons on april NUM NUM
fitzgerald called perkins on the day of publication to monitor reviews any news
sales situation doubtful read a wire from perkins on april NUM but excellent reviews 
fitzgerald responded on april NUM saying the cable depressed him closing the letter with yours in great depression 
fitzgerald had hoped the novel would be a great commercial success perhaps selling as many as NUM copies 
by october when the original sale had run its course the book had sold fewer than NUM copies 
despite this scribners continually kept the book in print they carried the original edition on their trade list until NUM by which time gatsby was in print in three other forms and the original edition was no longer needed 
fitzgerald received letters of praise from contemporaries t s eliot edith wharton and willa cather regarding the novel however this was private opinion and fitzgerald feverishly demanded the public recognition of reviewers and readers 
the great gatsby received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day 
generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was edwin clark of the new york times who felt the novel was a curious book a mystical glamourous sic story of today 
similarly lillian c ford of the los angeles times wrote the novel leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder calling the book a revelation of life and a work of art 
the new york post called the book fascinating .. his style fairly scintillates and with a genuine brilliance he writes surely and soundly 
the new york herald tribune was unimpressed but referred to the great gatsby as purely ephemeral phenomenon but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine-so light so delicate so sharp .. a literary lemon meringue 
in the chicago daily tribune hl 
mencken called the book in form no more than a glorified anecdote and not too probable at that while praising the books careful and brilliant finish 
several writers felt that the novel left much to be desired following fitzgeralds previous works and promptly criticized him 
harvey eagleton of the dallas morning news believed the novel signaled the end of fitzgeralds success one finishes great gatsby with a feeling of regret not for the fate of the people in the book but for mr 
fitzgerald 
john mcclure of the times-picayune said that the book was unconvincing writing even in conception and construction the great gatsby seems a little raw 
ralph coghlan of the st louis post-dispatch felt the book lacked what made fitzgeralds earlier novels endearing and called the book a minor performance .. at the moment its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical 
ruth snyder of new york evening world called the books style painfully forced noting that the editors of the paper were quite convinced after reading the great gatsby that mr fitzgerald is not one of the great american writers of to-day 
the reviews struck fitzgerald as completely missing the point all the reviews even the most enthusiastic not one had the slightest idea what the book was about 
fitzgeralds goal was to produce a literary work which would truly prove himself as a writer and gatsby did not have the commercial success of his two previous novels this side of paradise and the beautiful and damned
although the novel went through two initial printings some of these copies remained unsold years later 
fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time and gatsby did not contain an admirable female character 
according to his own ledger now made available online by university of south carolinas thomas cooper library he earned only NUM from the book 
although NUM brought owen davis stage adaption and the paramount-issued silent film version both of which brought in money for the author fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and most importantly would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye 
for several years afterward the general public believed the great gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece 
in NUM fitzgerald suffered a third and final heart attack and died believing his work forgotten 
his obituary in the new york times mentioned gatsby as fitzgerald at his best
a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles future writers edward newhouse and budd schulberg were deeply affected by it and john ohara showed the books influence 
the republication of gatsby in edmund wilsons edition of the last tycoon in NUM produced an outburst of comment with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction 
in NUM a group of publishing executives created the council on books in wartime 
the councils purpose was to distribute paperback books to soldiers fighting in the second world war 
the great gatsby was one of these books 
the books proved to be as popular as pin-up girls among the soldiers according to the saturday evening posts contemporary report 
NUM copies of gatsby were distributed to soldiers overseas .

by NUM full-length articles on fitzgeralds works were being published and the following year the opinion that gatsby was merely a period piece had almost entirely disappeared 
this revival was paved by interest shown by literary critic edmund wilson who was fitzgeralds friend 
in NUM arthur mizener published the far side of paradise a biography of fitzgerald 
he emphasized the great gatsbys positive reception by literary critics which may have influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it 
by NUM the book was steadily selling NUM copies per year and renewed interest led the new york times editorialist arthur mizener to proclaim the novel a classic of twentieth-century american fiction
the great gatsby has sold over NUM million copies worldwide as of NUM annually sells an additional NUM copies and is scribners most popular title in NUM the e-book alone sold NUM copies 
scribners copyright is scheduled to expire in NUM according to maureen corrigans book about the making of the great gatsby so we read on
the great gatsby has resulted in a number of film and television adaptations


the new york metropolitan opera commissioned john harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the NUMth anniversary of james levines debut

martin amis

martin louis amis born NUM august NUM is a british novelist essayist and memoirist 
his best-known novels are money NUM and london fields NUM
he has received the james tait black memorial prize for his memoir experience and has been listed for the booker prize twice to date shortlisted in NUM for times arrow and longlisted in NUM for yellow dog
amis served as the professor of creative writing at the centre for new writing at the university of manchester until NUM
in NUM the times named him one of the NUM greatest british writers since NUM
amiss work centres on the excesses of late-capitalist western society whose perceived absurdity he often satirises through grotesque caricature he has been portrayed as a master of what the new york times called the new unpleasantness
inspired by saul bellow vladimir nabokov and james joyce as well as by his father kingsley amis amis himself has gone on to influence many successful british novelists of the late NUMth and early NUMst centuries including will self and zadie smith 
amis was born in oxford england 
his father noted english novelist sir kingsley amis was the son of a mustard manufacturers clerk from clapham london his mother kingston upon thames-born hilary hilly a bardwell was the daughter of a ministry of agriculture civil servant 
he has an older brother philip his younger sister sally died in NUM
his parents married in NUM in oxford and divorced when he was twelve 
he attended a number of schools in the NUMs and NUMsincluding the bishop gore school swansea grammar school and cambridgeshire high school for boys where he was described by one headmaster as unusually unpromising
the acclaim that followed his fathers first novel lucky jim sent the family to princeton new jersey where his father lectured 
in NUM at the age of NUM he played john thornton in the film version of richard hughes a high wind in jamaica
he read nothing but comic books until his stepmother the novelist elizabeth jane howard introduced him to jane austen whom he often names as his earliest influence 
after teenage years spent in flowery shirts he graduated from exeter college oxford with a congratulatory first in english  the sort where you are called in for a viva and the examiners tell you how much they enjoyed reading your papers 
after oxford he found an entry-level job at the times literary supplement and at the age of NUM became literary editor of the new statesman where he met christopher hitchens then a feature writer for the observer who remained a close friend until hitchens died in NUM
at tall he referred to himself as a short-arse while a teenager 
the bitterness in his books and his much-publicised philandering have been widely noted 
according to amis his father showed no interest in his work 
i can point out the exact place where he stopped and sent money twirling through the air thats where the character named martin amis comes in 
breaking the rules buggering about with the reader drawing attention to himself kingsley complained 
his first novel the rachel papers NUM  written at lemmons the family home in north london  won the somerset maugham award 
the most traditional of his novels made into an unsuccessful cult film it tells the story of a bright egotistical teenager which amis acknowledges as autobiographical and his relationship with the eponymous girlfriend in the year before going to university 
he also wrote the screenplay for the film saturnNUM an experience which he was to draw on for his fifth novel money
dead babies NUM more flippant in tone chronicles a few days in the lives of some friends who convene in a country house to take drugs 
a number of amiss characteristics show up here for the first time mordant black humour obsession with the zeitgeist authorial intervention a character subjected to sadistically humorous misfortunes and humiliations and a defiant casualness my attitude has been i dont know much about science but i know what i like
a film adaptation was made in NUM
success NUM told the story of two foster-brothers gregory riding and terry service and their rising and falling fortunes 
this was the first example of amiss fondness for symbolically pairing characters in his novels which has been a recurrent feature in his fiction since martin amis and martina twain in money richard tull and gwyn barry in the information and jennifer rockwell and mike hoolihan in night train
other people a mystery story NUM about a young woman coming out of a coma was a transitional novel in that it was the first of amiss to show authorial intervention in the narrative voice and highly artificed language in the heroines descriptions of everyday objects which was said to be influenced by his contemporary craig raines martian school of poetry 
it was also the first novel amis wrote after committing to be a full-time writer 
amiss best-known novels are money london fields and the information commonly referred to as his london trilogy
although the books share little in terms of plot and narrative they all examine the lives of middle-aged men exploring the sordid debauched and post-apocalyptic undercurrents of life in late NUMth-century britain 
amiss london protagonists are anti-heroes they engage in questionable behaviour are passionate iconoclasts and strive to escape the apparent banality and futility of their lives 
he writes the world is like a human being 
and theres a scientific name for it which is entropyeverything tends towards disorder 
from an ordered state to a disordered state 
money NUM subtitled a suicide note is a first-person narrative by john self advertising man and would-be film director who is addicted to the twentieth century
a satire of thatcherite amorality and greed the novel relates a series of black comedic episodes as self flies back and forth across the atlantic in crass and seemingly chaotic pursuit of personal and professional success 
time included the novel in its list of the NUM best english-language novels of NUM to NUM
on NUM november NUM the guardian reported that the bbc had adapted money for television as part of their early NUM schedule for bbc NUM
nick frost played john self 
the television adaptation also featured vincent kartheiser emma pierson and jerry hall 
the adaptation was a two-part drama and was written by tom butterworth and chris hurford 
after the transmission of the first of the two parts amis was quick to praise the adaptation stating that all the performances were without weak spots 
i thought nick frost was absolutely extraordinary as john self 
he fills the character 
its a very unusual performance in that hes very funny hes physically comic but hes also strangely graceful a pleasure to watch ..it looked very expensive even though it wasnt and thats a feat ..the earlier script i saw was disappointing but they took it back and worked on it and its hugely improved 
my advice was to use more of the language of the novel the dialogue rather than making it up 
london fields NUM amiss longest work describes the encounters between three main characters in london in NUM as a climate disaster approaches 
the characters have typically amisian names and broad caricatured qualities keith talent the lower-class crook with a passion for darts nicola six a femme fatale who is determined to be murdered and upper-middle-class guy clinch the fool the foil the poor foal who is destined to come between the other two 
the book was controversially omitted from the booker prize shortlist in NUM because two panel members maggie gee and helen mcneil disliked amiss treatment of his female characters 
it was an incredible row martyn goff the bookers director told the independent
maggie and helen felt that amis treated women appallingly in the book 
that is not to say they thought books which treated women badly couldnt be good they simply felt that the author should make it clear he didnt favour or bless that sort of treatment 
really there was only two of them and they should have been outnumbered as the other three were in agreement but such was the sheer force of their argument and passion that they won 
david lodge has told me he regrets it to this day he feels he failed somehow by not saying its two against three martins on the list.
amiss NUM novel the short times arrow was shortlisted for the man booker prize 
notable for its backwards narrativeincluding dialogue in reversethe novel is the autobiography of a nazi concentration camp doctor 
the reversal of time in the novel a technique borrowed from kurt vonneguts slaughterhouse NUM NUM and philip k dicks counter-clock world NUM seemingly transforms auschwitzand the entire theatre of warinto a place of joy healing and resurrection 
the information NUM was notable not so much for its critical success but for the scandals surrounding its publication 
the enormous advance an alleged NUM demanded and subsequently obtained by amis for the novel attracted what the author described as an eisteddfod of hostility from writers and critics after he abandoned his long-serving agent the late pat kavanagh in order to be represented by the harvard-educated andrew the jackal wylie 
the split was by no means amicable it created a rift between amis and his long-time friend julian barnes who was married to kavanagh 
according to amiss autobiography experience NUM he and barnes had not resolved their differences 
the information itself deals with the relationship between a pair of british writers of fiction 
one a spectacularly successful purveyor of airport novels is envied by his friend an equally unsuccessful writer of philosophical and generally abstruse prose 
the novel is written in the authors classic style characters appearing as stereotyped caricatures grotesque elaborations on the wickedness of middle age and a general air of post-apocalyptic malaise 
amiss NUM offering the short novel night train is narrated by the mannish american detective mike hoolihan 
the story revolves around the suicide of her bosss young beautiful and seemingly happy daughter 
like most of amiss work night train is dark bleak and foreboding arguably a reflection of the authors views on america 
amiss distinctively american vernacular in the narrative was criticized by among others john updike although the novel found defenders elsewhere notably in janis bellow wife of amiss sometime mentor and friend saul bellow 
the NUMs were amiss least productive decade in terms of full-length fiction since starting in the NUMs two novels in ten years while his non-fiction work saw a dramatic uptick in volume three published works including a memoir a hybrid of semi-memoir and amateur political history and another journalism collection
in NUM amis published a memoir called experience
largely concerned with the strange relationship between the author and his father the novelist kingsley amis the autobiography nevertheless deals with many facets of amiss life 
of particular note is amiss reunion with his daughter delilah seale resulting from an affair in the NUMs whom he did not see until she was NUM
amis also discusses at some length the murder of his cousin lucy partington by fred west when she was NUM
the book was awarded the james tait black memorial prize for biography 
in NUM amis published  a devastating history of the crimes of lenin and stalin and their denial by many writers and academics in the west 
the book precipitated a literary controversy for its approach to the material and for its attack on amiss long-time friend christopher hitchens 
amis accuses hitchens  who was once a committed leftist  of sympathy for stalin and communism 
although hitchens wrote a vituperative response to the book in the atlantic his friendship with amis emerged unchanged in response to a reporters question amis responded we never needed to make up 
we had an adult exchange of views mostly in print and that was that or more exactly that goes on being that
my friendship with the hitch has always been perfectly cloudless 
it is a love whose month is ever may 
in NUM yellow dog amiss first novel in six years was published 
the novel drew mixed reviews and was most notably denounced by the novelist tibor fischer yellow dog isnt bad as in not very good or slightly disappointing 
its not-knowing-where-to-look bad 
i was reading my copy on the tube and i was terrified someone would look over my shoulder its like your favourite uncle being caught in a school playground masturbating 
elsewhere the book received mixed reviews with some critics proclaiming the novel a return to form but most considered the book to be a great disappointment 
amis was unrepentant about the novel and its reaction calling yellow dog among my best three
he gave his own explanation
for the novels critical failure no one wants to read a difficult literary novel or deal with a prose style which reminds them how thick they are 
theres a push towards egalitarianism making writing more chummy and interactive instead of a higher voice and thats what i go to literature for 
yellow dog controversially made the NUM-book longlist for the NUM booker prize despite some scathing reviews but failed to win the award 
following the harsh reviews afforded to yellow dog amis relocated from london to uruguay with his family for two years during which time he worked on his next novel away from the glare and pressures of the london literary scene 
in september NUM upon his return from uruguay amis published his eleventh novel 
house of meetings a short work continued the authors crusade against the crimes of stalinism and also saw some consideration of the state of contemporary post-soviet russia 
the novel centres on the relationship between two brothers incarcerated in a prototypical siberian gulag who prior to their deportation had loved the same woman 
house of meetings saw some better critical notices than yellow dog had received three years before but there were still some reviewers who felt that amiss fiction work had considerably declined in quality while others felt that he was not suited to writing an ostensibly serious historical novel 
despite the praise for house of meetings once again amis was overlooked for the booker prize longlist 
according to a piece in the independent the novel was originally to have been collected alongside two short stories  one a disturbing account of the life of
a body-double in the court of saddam hussein the other the imagined final moments of muhammad atta the leader of NUM september attacks  but late in the process amis decided to jettison both from the book 
the same article asserts that amis had recently abandoned a novella the unknown known the title was based on one of donald rumsfelds characteristically strangulated linguistic formulations in which muslim terrorists unleash a horde of compulsive rapists on a town called greeley colorado and instead continued to work on a follow-up full novel that he had started working on in NUM
the novel im working on is blindingly autobiographical but with an islamic theme 
its called a pregnant widow because at the end of a revolution you dont have a newborn child you have a pregnant widow 
and the pregnant widow in this novel is feminism 
which is still in its second trimester 
the child is nowhere in sight yet 
and i think it has several more convulsions to undergo before well see the child 
the new novel took some considerable time to write and was not published before the end of the decade 
instead amiss last published work of the NUMs was the NUM journalism collection the second plane a collection which compiled amiss many writings on the events of NUM and the subsequent major events and cultural issues resulting from the war on terror 
the reception to the second plane was decidedly mixed with some reviewers finding its tone intelligent and well reasoned while others believed it to be overly stylised and lacking in authoritative knowledge of key areas under consideration 
the most common consensus was that the two short stories included were the weakest point of the collection 
the collection sold relatively well and was widely discussed and debated 
in NUM after a long period of writing rewriting editing and revision amis published his long-awaited new long novel the pregnant widow which is concerned with the sexual revolution 
originally set for release in NUM the novels publication was pushed back as further editing and alterations were being made expanding it to some NUM pages 
the title of the novel is based on a quote by alexander herzen

the death of the contemporary forms of social order ought to gladden rather than trouble the soul 
yet what is frightening is that what the departing world leaves behind it is not an heir but a pregnant widow 
between the death of the one and the birth of the other much water will flow by a long night of chaos and desolation will pass 
the first public reading of the then just completed version of the pregnant widow occurred on NUM may NUM as part of the norwich and norfolk festival 
at this reading according to the coverage of the event for the norwich writers centre by katy carr the writing shows a return to comic form as the narrator muses on the indignities of facing the mirror as an ageing man in a prelude to a story set in italy in NUM looking at the effect of the sexual revolution on personal relationships 
the sexual revolution was the moment as amis sees it that love became divorced from sex 
he said he started to write the novel autobiographically but then concluded that real life was too different from fiction and difficult to drum into novel shape so he had to rethink the form 
the story is set in a castle owned by a cheese tycoon in campania italy where keith nearing a NUM-year-old english literature student his girlfriend lily and her friend scheherazade are on holiday during the hot summer of NUM the year that amis says something was changing in the world of men and women
the narrator is keiths superego or conscience in NUM
keiths sister violet is based on amiss own sister sally described by amis as one of the revolutions most spectacular victims 
published in a whirl of publicity the likes of which amis had not received for a novel since the publication of the information in NUM the pregnant widow once again saw amis receiving mixed reviews from the press and sales being average at best 
despite a vast amount of coverage some positive reviews and a general expectation that amiss time for recognition had come the novel was overlooked for the NUM man booker prize long list 
in NUM amis published 
the novel is centered on the lives of desmond pepperdine and his uncle lionel asbo a voracious yob and persistent convict 
it is set against the fictional borough of diston town a grotesque version of modern-day britain under the reign of celebrity culture and follows the dramatic events in the lives of both characters desmonds gradual erudition and maturing and lionels fantastic lottery win of approximately NUMmillion pounds 
much to the interest of the press amis based the character of lionel asbos eventual girlfriend the ambitious glamour model and poet threnody quotation marks included on the british celebrity jordan 
in an interview with newsnights jeremy paxman amis said the novel was not a frowning examination of england but a comedy based on a fairytale world adding that  was not an attack on the country insisting he was proud of being english and viewed the nation with affection 
reviews once again were largely mixed 
amiss NUM novel the zone of interest concerns the holocaust his second work of fiction to tackle the subject after times arrow
in it amis tries to imagine the social and domestic lives of the nazi officers who ran the death camps and the effect their indifference to human suffering had on their general psychology 
in december NUM amis announced two new projects 
the first a collection of journalism titled the rub of time bellow nabokov hitchens travolta trump 
essays and reportage NUM-NUM is due for publication in october NUM
the second project a new untitled novel which amis is currently working on is an autobiographical novel about three key literary figures in his life the poet philip larkin american novelist saul bellow and noted public intellectual christopher hitchens 
in an interview with livemintcom amis said of the novel-in-progress im writing an autobiographical novel that ive been trying to write for NUM years 
its not so much about me its about three other writersa poet a novelist and an essayistphilip larkin saul bellow and christopher hitchens and since i started trying to write it larkin died in NUM bellow died in NUM and hitch died in NUM and that gives me a theme death and it gives me a bit more freedom and fiction is freedom 
its hard going but the one benefit is that i have the freedom to invent things 
i dont have them looking over my shoulder anymore 
on writing amis said in NUM i think of writing as more mysterious as i get older not less mysterious 
the whole process is very weirdit is very spooky 
amis has also released two collections of short stories einsteins monsters and heavy water four volumes of collected journalism and criticism   the war against clich and the second plane and a guide to NUMs space-themed arcade video-game machines which he has since disavowed invasion of the space invaders
he has also regularly appeared on television and radio discussion and debate programmes and contributes book reviews and articles to newspapers 
his wife isabel fonseca released her debut novel attachment in NUM and two of amiss children his son louis and his daughter fernanda have also been published in their own right in standpoint magazine and the guardian respectively 
amis returned to britain in september NUM after living in uruguay for two and a half years with his second wife the writer isabel fonseca and their two young daughters 
amis became a grandfather in NUM when his daughter by lamorna seale delilah gave birth to a son 
he said some strange things have happened it seems to me in my absence 
i didnt feel like i was getting more rightwing when i was in uruguay but when i got back i felt that i had moved quite a distance to the right while staying in the same place 
he reports that he is disquieted by what he sees as increasingly undisguised hostility towards israel and the united states 
in late NUM amis bought a property in the cobble hill area of brooklyn new york although it is unclear whether he will be permanently moving to new york or just maintaining another sock there 
in NUM amis wrote in the new republic that he was moving house from camden town in london to cobble hill 
through the NUMs and NUMs amis was a strong critic of nuclear proliferation 
his collection of five stories on this theme einsteins monsters began with a long essay entitled thinkability in which he set out his views on the issue writing nuclear weapons repel all thought perhaps because they can end all thought 
he wrote in nuclear city in esquire of NUM re-published in visiting mrsnabokov that when nuclear weapons become real to you when they stop buzzing around your ears and actually move into your head hardly an hour passes without some throb or flash some heavy pulse of imagined supercatastrophe
the marxist critic terry eagleton in the NUM introduction to his work ideology singled out and attacked amis for a particular quote which eagleton mistakenly attributed to one of amiss essays taken the day after the NUM transatlantic aircraft plot came to light in an informal interview in the times magazine
amis was quoted as saying what can we do to raise the price of them doing this
theres a definite urge  dont you have it
to say the muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order 
what sort of suffering
not letting them travel 
deportation  further down the road 
curtailing of freedoms 
strip-searching people who look like theyre from the middle east or from pakistan discriminatory stuff until it hurts the whole community and they start getting tough with their children ..its a huge dereliction on their part
eagleton wrote that this view is not the ramblings of a british national party thug ... but the reflections of martin amis leading luminary of the english metropolitan literary world
in a highly critical article in the guardian the absurd world of martin amis satirist chris morris likened amis to the muslim cleric abu hamza who was jailed for inciting racial hatred in NUM suggesting that both men employ mock erudition vitriol and decontextualised quotes from the quran to incite hatred 
in a later piece eagleton added but there is something rather stomach-churning at the sight of those such as amis and his political allies champions of a civilisation that for centuries has wreaked untold carnage throughout the world shrieking for illegal measures when they find themselves for the first time on the sticky end of the same treatment 
elsewhere amis was especially careful to distinguish between islam and radical islamism stating that

prominent british muslim yasmin alibhai-brown wrote an op-ed piece on the subject condemning amis and he responded with an open letter to the independent which the newspaper printed in full 
in it he stated his views had been misrepresented by both alibhai-brown and eagleton 
in an article in the guardian amis subsequently wrote

on terrorism martin amis wrote that he suspected there exists on our planet a kind of human being who will become a muslim in order to pursue suicide-mass murder and added i will never forget the look on the gatekeepers face at the dome of the rock in jerusalem when i suggested perhaps rather airily that he skip some calendric prohibition and let me in anyway 
his expression previously cordial and cold became a mask and the mask was saying that killing me my wife and my children was something for which he now had warrant 
in comments on the bbc in october NUM amis expressed his view that north korea was the most dangerous of the two remaining members of the axis of evil but that iran was our natural enemy suggesting that we should not feel bad about having helped iraq scrape a draw with iran in the iraniraq war because a revolutionary and rampant iran would have been a much more destabilising presence 
his views on radical islamism earned him the contentious sobriquet blitcon from the new statesman his former employer
this term it has since been argued was wrongly applied 
his political opinions have been attacked in some quarters particularly in the guardian
he has received support from other writers 
in the spectator philip hensher noted

in june NUM amis endorsed the presidential candidacy of barack obama stating that the reason i hope for obama is that he alone has the chance to reposition americas image in the world
however when briefly interviewed by the bbc during its coverage of the NUM presidential election amis displayed a change in tone stating that he was depressed and frightened by the us election rather than excited 
blaming a deep irrationality of the american people for the apparent narrow gap between the candidates amis claimed that the republicans had swung so far to the right that former president reagan would be considered a pariah by the present party - and invited viewers to imagine a conservative party in the uk which had moved to the right so much that it disowned margaret thatcher tax cuts for the rich he said theres not a democracy on earth where that would be mentioned
in october NUM he attacked jeremy corbyn in an article for the sunday times describing him as humourless and under-educated
amis received criticism from other writers for this attack 
howard jacobson writing for the independent described amiss comments as splenetic snobby and unashamedly ad hominem
in the guardian owen jones was critical of academic snobbery and remarked that amis was born into significant privilege being the son of sir kingsley amis 
also in the independent terence blacker criticised amiss article as snobbery and patronising noting that amis was born into social and cultural privilege 
blacker wrote that amiss article was an unintentionally hilarious piece and a diatribe whilst also suggesting amis would inadvertently convert many to supporting corbyn instead 
in NUM amis said that agnostic is the only respectable position simply because our ignorance of the universe is so vast that atheism is premature
clearly theres not going to be any kind of anthropomorphic entity at all but the universe is so incredibly complicated so over our heads that we cannot exclude the existence of an intelligence behind it 
in NUM he said im an agnostic which is the only rational position 
its not because i feel a god or think that anything resembling the banal god of religion will turn up 
but i think that atheism sounds like a proof of something and its incredibly evident that we are nowhere near intelligent enough to understand the universe ..writers are above all individualists and above all writing is freedom so they will go off in all sorts of directions 
i think it does apply to the debate about religion in that its a crabbed novelist who pulls the shutters down and says theres no other thing 
dont use the word god but something more intelligent than us .
if we cant understand it then its formidable 
and we understand very little 
in february NUM martin amis was appointed as a professor of creative writing at the manchester centre for new writing in the university of manchester and started in september NUM
he ran postgraduate seminars and participated in four public events each year including a two-week summer school 
of his position he said i may be acerbic in how i write but ..i would find it very difficult to say cruel things to students in such a vulnerable position 
i imagine ill be surprisingly sweet and gentle with them 
he predicted that the experience might inspire him to write a new book while adding sardonically a campus novel written by an elderly novelist thats what the world wants 
it was revealed that the salary paid to amis by the university was NUM a year 
the manchester evening news broke the story claiming that according to his contract this meant he was paid NUM an hour for NUMhours a year teaching 
the claim was echoed in headlines in several national papers 
as with any other member of academic staff his teaching contract hours constituted a minority of his commitments a point confirmed in the original article by a reply from the university 
in january NUM it was announced that he would be stepping down from his university position at the end of the current academic year 
of his time teaching creative writing at manchester university amis was quoted as saying teaching creative writing at manchester has been a joy and that he had become very fond of my colleagues especially john mcauliffe and ian mcguire
he added that he loved doing all the reading and the talking and i very much took to the mancunians 
they are a witty and tolerant contingent
amis was succeeded in this position by the irish writer colm tibn in september NUM
from october NUM to july NUM at manchester universitys whitworth hall or at the cosmo rodewald concert hall martin amis regularly engaged in public discussions with other experts on literature and various topics NUMst-century literature terrorism religion philip larkin science britishness suicide sex ageing his NUM novel the pregnant widow violence film the short story and america
don delillo

donald richard don delillo born november NUM NUM is an american novelist playwright and essayist 
his works have covered subjects as diverse as television nuclear war sports the complexities of language performance art the cold war mathematics the advent of the digital age politics economics and global terrorism 
initially he was a well-regarded cult writer however the publication in NUM of white noise brought him widespread recognition and won him the national book award for fiction 
it was followed in NUM by libra a bestseller 
delillo has twice been a pulitzer prize for fiction finalist for mao ii in NUM and for underworld in NUM won the penfaulkner award for mao ii in NUM receiving a further penfaulkner award nomination for the angel esmeralda in NUM was granted the pensaul bellow award for achievement in american fiction in NUM and won the library of congress prize for american fiction in NUM
delillo has described his fiction as being concerned with living in dangerous times and in a NUM interview declared writers must oppose systems 
its important to write against power corporations the state and the whole system of consumption and of debilitating entertainments ... i think writers by nature must oppose things oppose whatever power tries to impose on us 
delillo was born on november NUM NUM and grew up in a working-class italian catholic family from molise in an italian-american neighborhood of the bronx in new york city not far from arthur avenue 
reflecting on his childhood in the bronx delillo later described how he was ...always out in the street 
as a little boy i whiled away most of my time pretending to be a baseball announcer on the radio 
i could think up games for hours at a time 
there were eleven of us in a small house but the close quarters were never a problem 
i didnt know things any other way 
we always spoke english and italian all mixed up together 
my grandmother who lived in america for fifty years never learned english 
as a teenager delillo was not interested in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit 
in a NUM interview with the australian delillo reflected on this period by saying i had a personal golden age of reading in my NUMs and my early NUMs and then my writing began to take up so much time
among the writers delillo read and was inspired by in this period were james joyce william faulkner flannery oconnor and ernest hemingway who was a major influence on delillos earliest attempts at writing in his late teens 
as well as the influence of modernist fiction delillo has also cited the influence of jazz music  guys like ornette coleman and mingus and coltrane and miles davis  and postwar cinema antonioni and godard and truffaut and then in the NUMs came the americans many of whom were influenced by the europeans kubrick altman coppola scorsese and so on 
i dont know how they may have affected the way i write but i do have a visual sense 
on the influence of film particularly european cinema on his work delillo has said european and asian cinemas of the NUMs shaped the way i think and feel about things 
at that time i was living in new york i didnt have much money didnt have much work i was living in one room ..i was a man in a small room 
and i went to the movies a lot watching bergman antonioni godard 
when i was little in the bronx i didnt go to the cinema and i didnt think of the american films i saw as works of art 
perhaps in an indirect way cinema allowed me to become a writer 
delillo also credits his parents leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career they ultimately trusted me to follow the course id chosen 
this is something that happens if youre the eldest son in an italian family you get a certain leeway and it worked in my case 
after graduating from cardinal hayes high school in the bronx in NUM and from fordham university in the bronx with a bachelors degree in communication arts in NUM delillo took a job in advertising because he couldnt get one in publishing 
he worked for five years as a copywriter at the agency of ogilvy  mather on fifth avenue at east NUMth street writing image ads for sears roebuck among others working on print ads very undistinguished accounts ..i hadnt made the leap to television 
i was just getting good at it when i left in NUM.
delillo published his first short story in NUMthe river jordan in epoch the literary magazine of cornell universityand began to work on his first novel in NUM
discussing the beginning of his writing career delillo said i did some short stories at that time but very infrequently 
i quit my job just to quit 
i didnt quit my job to write fiction 
i just didnt want to work anymore 
reflecting in NUM on his relatively late start in writing fiction delillo said i wish i had started earlier but evidently i wasnt ready 
first i lacked ambition 
i may have had novels in my head but very little on paper and no personal goals no burning desire to achieve some end 
second i didnt have a sense of what it takes to be a serious writer 
it took me a long time to develop this 
delillos inaugural decade of novel writing has been his most productive to date resulting in the writing and publication of six novels in eight years between NUM and NUM
he resigned from the advertising industry in NUM moved into a modest apartment near the queens-midtown tunnel it wasnt paris in the NUMs but i was happy delillo has said of this time and began work on his first novel 
reflecting on the early days of his writing career he remarked i lived in a very minimal kind of way 
my telephone would be NUM.NUM every month 
i was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month 
and i was becoming a writer 
so in one sense i was ignoring the movements of the time 
his first novel americana was written over the course of four years and finally published in NUM to modest critical praise 
americana concerned a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture
delillo revised the novel in NUM for paperback re-printing 
reflecting on the novel later in his career he admitted i dont think my first novel would have been published today as i submitted it 
i dont think an editor would have read NUM pages of it 
it was very overdone and shaggy but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published 
later still delillo still felt a degree of surprise at americana being published noting i was working on my first novel americana for two years before i ever realized that i could be a writer ... i had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because i knew that there were elements that i simply didnt know how to improve at that point 
so i wrote for another two years and finished the novel 
it wasnt all that difficult to find a publisher to my astonishment 
i didnt have a representative 
i didnt know anything about publishing 
but an editor at houghton mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing 
americana was followed in rapid succession by the american college footballnuclear war black comedy end zone NUM  written under the working-titles the self-erasing word and modes of disaster technology  and the rock and roll satire great jones street NUM which delillo later felt was one of the books i wish id done differently 
it should be tighter and probably a little funnier 
he married barbara bennett a former banker turned landscape designer in NUM
delillos fourth novel ratners star NUM  which according to delillo is structured ... on the writings of lewis carroll in particular alice in wonderland and alice through the looking glass  took two years to write and drew numerous favorable comparisons to the works of thomas pynchon 
this conceptual monster as delillo scholar tom leclair describes it is the picaresque story of a NUM-year-old math genius who joins an international consortium of mad scientists decoding an alien message 
and has been cited by delillo as both one of the most difficult books to write and his personal favorite of his own novels 
following this early attempt at a major long novel delillo ended the decade with two shorter works 
players NUM originally conceived as being based on what could be called the intimacy of language 
what people who live together really sound like concerned the lives of a young yuppie couple as the husband gets involved with a cell of domestic terrorists 
its NUM successor running dog NUM written in a brief four-month streak of writing was a thriller concerning numerous individuals hunting down a celluloid reel of hitlers sexual exploits 
of running dog delillo remarked in his rolling stone interview that what i was really getting at in running dog was a sense of the terrible acquisitiveness in which we live coupled with a final indifference to the object 
after all the mad attempts to acquire the thing everyone suddenly decides that well maybe we really dont care about this so much anyway 
this was something i felt characterized our lives at the time the book was written in the mid to late seventies 
i think this was part of american consciousness then 
in NUM delillo was awarded the guggenheim fellowship which he used to fund a trip around the middle east before settling in greece where he would write his next novels amazons and the names
reflecting on his first six novels and his rapid writing turnover later in his career delillo remarked i wasnt learning to slow down and examine what i was doing more closely 
i dont have regrets about that work but i do think that if i had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book i might have produced somewhat better work in the NUMs 
my first novel took so long and was such an effort that once i was free of it i almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade stopping in a way only at ratners star NUM which was an enormous challenge for me and probably a bigger challenge for the reader 
but i slowed down in the NUMs and NUMs 
delillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his NUMs works reflecting in NUM i knew i wasnt doing utterly serious work let me put it that way 
the beginning of the NUMs saw the most unusual and uncharacteristic publication in delillos career 
the sports novel amazons a mock memoir of the first woman to play in the national hockey league is a far more lighthearted and more evidently commercial novel than his previous and subsequent novels 
delillo published the novel under the pseudonym cleo birdwell and later requested publishers compiling a bibliography for a reprint of a later novel to expunge the novel from their lists 
while delillo spent several years living in greece he took three years to write the names NUM a complex thriller concerning a risk analyst who crosses paths with a cult of assassins in the middle east
while lauded by an increasing number of literary critics delillo was still relatively unknown outside of small academic circles and did not reach a wide readership with this novel 
also in NUM delillo finally broke his self-imposed ban on media coverage by giving his first major interview to tom leclair who had first tracked delillo down for an interview while he was in greece in NUM
on that occasion delillo had handed leclair a business card with his name printed on it and beneath that the message i dont want to talk about it 
with the publication of his eighth novel white noise in NUM delillo began a rapid ascendancy to being a noted and respected novelist 
white noise was arguably a major breakthrough both commercially and artistically for delillo earning him a national book award for fiction and a place among the academic canon of contemporary postmodern novelists 
delillo remained as detached as ever from his growing reputation when called upon to give an acceptance speech for the award he simply said im sorry i couldnt be here tonight but i thank you all for coming and then sat down 
the influence and impact of white noise can be seen in the writing of such authors as david foster wallace jonathan lethem jonathan franzen dave eggers martin amis zadie smith and richard powers who provides an introduction to the NUMth anniversary edition of the novel
among the NUM proposed titles for the novel were all souls ultrasonic the american book of the dead psychic data and mein kampf however delillo acknowledged in a NUM interview that white noise was a fine choice remarking once a title is affixed to a book it becomes as indelible as a sentence or a paragraph 
delillo followed white noise with libra NUM a speculative fictionalized take on the life of lee harvey oswald up to the NUM assassination of john f kennedy 
for this novel delillo undertook a vast research project which included reading at least half of the warren commission report subsequently delillo described it as the oxford english dictionary of the assassination and also the joycean novel 
this is the one document that captures the full richness and madness and meaning of the event despite the fact that it omits about a ton and a half of material 
originally written with the working title of either american blood or texas school book libra became an international bestseller one of five finalists for the national book award and winner of the next years irish times aer lingus international fiction prize 
the novel also elicited fierce critical division with some critics praising delillos take on the kennedy assassination while others decried it 
george will in a washington post article declared the book to be an affront to america and an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship
delillo has frequently reflected on the significance of the kennedy assassination to not only his own work but american culture and history as a whole remarking in one NUM interview november NUMnd NUM marked the real beginning of the NUMs 
it was the beginning of a series of catastrophes political assassinations the war in vietnam the denial of civil rights and the revolts that occasioned youth revolt in american cities right up to watergate 
when i was starting out as a writer it seemed to me that a large part of the material you could find in my novels  this sense of fatality of widespread suspicion of mistrust  came from the assassination of jfk 
delillos concerns about the position of the novelist and the novel in a media- and terrorist-dominated society were made clear in his next novel mao ii NUM
clearly influenced by the events surrounding the fatwa placed upon the author salman rushdie and the intrusion of the press into the life of the reclusive writer jd 
salinger mao ii earned delillo significant critical praise from among others fellow authors john banville and thomas pynchon 
he earned a penfaulkner award and a pulitzer prize finalist nomination for mao ii in NUM and NUM respectively 
following mao ii delillo went to ground and spent several years writing and researching his eleventh novel 
aside from the publication of a folio short story entitled pafko at the wall in a NUM edition of harpers magazine and one short story in NUM little was seen or heard of him for a number of years 
in NUM delillo finally broke cover with his long-awaited eleventh novel the epic cold war history underworld
the book was widely heralded as a masterpiece with novelist and critic martin amis saying it marked the ascension of a great writer 
underworld went on to become delillos most acclaimed novel to date achieving mainstream success and earning nominations for the national book award and the new york times best books of the year in NUM and a second pulitzer prize for fiction nomination in NUM
the novel went on to win the NUM american book award the NUM jerusalem prize and both the william dean howells medal and riccardo bacchelli international award in NUM
it was a runner-up in the NUM new york times survey of the best american fiction of the last NUM years 
white noise and libra were also recognized by the anonymous jury of contemporary writers 
delillo has subsequently expressed surprise at the success of the novel 
in NUM he candidly remarked when i finished with underworld i didnt really have any all-too-great hopes to be honest 
its some pretty complicated stuff NUM pages more than NUM different characters  whos going to be interested in that
after re-reading it again in NUM over ten years after its publication delillo commented that re-reading it made me wonder whether i would be capable of that kind of writing now  the range and scope of it 
there are certain parts of the book where the exuberance the extravagance i dont know the overindulgence ..there are city scenes in new york that seem to transcend reality in a certain way 
although they have received some acclaim in places delillos post-underworld novels have been often viewed by critics as disappointing and slight especially when held up against his earlier big-canvas epics marking a shift ...away from sweeping era-defining novels such as white noise libra and underworld to a more spare and oblique style characterized by ... decreased length the decommissioning of plot machinery and the steep deceleration of narrative time
delillo has commented on this shift to shorter novels saying if a longer novel announces itself ill write it 
a novel creates its own structure and develops its own terms 
i tend to follow 
and i never try to stretch what i sense is a compact book 
in a march NUM interview it was reported that delillos deliberate stylistic shift had been informed by his having recently re-read several slim but seminal european novels including albert camuss the stranger peter handkes the goalies anxiety at the penalty kick and max frischs man in the holocene
after the publication and extensive publicity drive for underworld delillo once again retreated from the spotlight to write his twelfth novel surfacing with the body artist in NUM
the novel contained many established delillo preoccupations particularly its interest in performance art and domestic privacies in relation to the wider scope of events 
however the slight and brief novella was very different in style and tone to the epic history of underworld and met with a mixed critical reception 
delillo followed the body artist with NUMs cosmopolis a modern re-interpretation of james joyces ulysses transposed to new york around the time of the collapse of the dot-com bubble in the year NUM
this novel was met at the time with a largely negative reception from critics with several high-profile critics and novelists  notably john updike  voicing their objections to the novels style and tone 
when asked in NUM how he felt about the novels mixed reception compared to the broader positive consensus afforded to underworld delillo remarked i try to stay detached from that aspect of my work as a writer 
i didnt read any reviews or articles 
maybe it the negative reception was connected to september NUM
id almost finished writing the book when the attacks took place and so they couldnt have had any influence on the books conception nor on its writing 
perhaps for certain readers this upset their expectations 
however subsequently critical opinions have been revised the novel latterly being seen as prescient for its views on the flaws and weaknesses of the international financial system and cybercapital 
delillos papers were acquired in NUM by the harry ransom humanities research center at the university of texas at austin reputedly for half a million dollars
there are one hundred and twenty-five boxes of delillo materials including various drafts and correspondence 
of his decision to donate his papers to the ransom center delillo is quoted in a fax to curator tom staley as explaining his donation being motivated by the following i ran out of space and also felt as one does at a certain age that i was running out of time 
i didnt want to leave behind an enormous mess of papers for family members to deal with 
of course ive since produced more paper  novel play essay etc 
and so the cycle begins again 
delillo returned with what would turn out to be his final novel of the decade with falling man in may NUM
the novel concerned the impact on one family of the NUM terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york an intimate story which is encompassed by a global event 
according to a NUM interview in die zeit delillo claims that originally he didnt ever want to write a novel about NUM and had an idea for a different book which he had been working on for half a year in NUM when he came up with an idea for the novel beginning work on the novel following the re-election of george w bush that november 
although highly anticipated and eagerly awaited by critics who felt that delillo was one of the contemporary writers best equipped to tackle the events of NUM in novelistic form the novel met with a mixed critical reception and garnered no major literary awards or nominations 
delillo however remained unconcerned by this relative lack of critical acclaim remarking in NUM in the NUMs when i started writing novels i was a figure in the margins and thats where i belonged 
if im headed back that way thats fine with me because thats always where i felt i belonged 
things changed for me in the NUMs and NUMs but ive always preferred to be somewhere in the corner of a room observing 
on april NUM NUM delillo received another significant literary award the NUM common wealth award for literature given by pnc bank of delaware 
on july NUM NUM entertainment weekly announced that the director david cronenberg a history of violence naked lunch would write a screenplay adaptation of don delillos NUM novel cosmopolis with a view to eventually direct 
cosmopolis eventually released in NUM became the first direct adaptation for the screen of a delillo novel although both libra and underworld had previously been optioned for screen treatments 
there had been discussions about adapting earlier novel end zone and delillo himself has written an original screenplay for the film game NUM
on november NUM NUM delillo published a new original short story called midnight in dostoevsky in the new yorker magazine 
it was his first new original short story published since still life in NUM prior to the release of falling man
delillo ended the decade by making an unexpected appearance at a pen event on the steps of the new york city public library NUMth ave and NUMnd st in support of chinese dissident writer liu xiaobo who was sentenced to eleven years in prison for inciting subversion of state power on december NUM NUM
delillo published point omega his fifteenth novel in february NUM
according to delillo the novel considers an idea from the writing of the jesuit thinker and paleontologist pierre teilhard de chardin 
the omega point of the title is the possible idea that human consciousness is reaching a point of exhaustion and that what comes next may be either a paroxysm or something enormously sublime and unenvisionable 
point omega is delillos shortest novel to date and he has said it could be considered as a companion piece to the body artist in its reflections on time and loss this may be a philosophical novel and maybe considering its themes the book shares a place in my work with the body artist another novel of abbreviated length 
reviews thus far have been polarised with some saying the novel is a return to form and innovative while others have complained about the novels brevity and apparent lack of plot and engaging characters 
upon its initial release point omega spent one week on the new york times bestseller list peaking at NUM on the extended version of the list during its one-week stay on the list 
in a january NUM NUM interview with the wall street journal delillo discussed at great length point omega his views of writing and his plans for the future 
when asked about why his recent novels had been shorter delillo replied each book tells me what it wants or what it is and id be perfectly content to write another long novel 
it just has to happen 
while delillo is open to the idea of returning to the form of the long novel the interview also revealed that he currently has no interest in doing as many of his literary contemporaries have done and writing a memoir 
delillo also made some observations on the state of literature and the challenges facing young writers
its tougher to be a young writer today than when i was a young writer 
i dont think my first novel would have been published today as i submitted it 
i dont think an editor would have read NUM pages of it 
it was very overdone and shaggy but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published 
i dont think publishers have that kind of tolerance these days and i guess possibly as a result more writers go to writing class now than then 
i think first fiction and second novels are much more refined in terms of language but they may tend to be too well behaved almost in response to the narrower market 
however in a february NUM NUM interview with the times newspaper delillo re-affirmed his belief in the validity and importance of the novel in a technology- and media-driven age offering a more optimistic opinion of the future of the novel than his contemporary philip roth had done in a recent interview

it is the form that allows a writer the greatest opportunity to explore human experience ..for that reason reading a novel is potentially a significant act 
because there are so many varieties of human experience so many kinds of interaction between humans and so many ways of creating patterns in the novel that cant be created in a short story a play a poem or a movie 
the novel simply offers more opportunities for a reader to understand the world better including the world of artistic creation 
that sounds pretty grand but i think its true 
delillo received two further significant literary awards in NUM the st louis literary award for his entire body of work to date on october NUM NUM previous recipients include salman rushdie el doctorow john updike william gass joyce carol oates joan didion and tennessee williams and his second pen award the pensaul bellow award for achievement in american fiction on october NUM NUM

delillo received the NUM carl sandburg literary award on october NUM NUM on the campus of the university of illinois at chicago 
the prize is presented annually to an acclaimed author in recognition of outstanding contributions to the literary world and honors a significant work or body of work that has enhanced the publics awareness of the written word

on april NUM NUM it was announced that delillo had received the inaugural library of congress prize for american fiction formerly the library of congress creative achievement award for fiction with the presentation of the award due to take place during the NUM library of congress national book festival sept NUM NUM
the prize honours an american literary writer whose body of work is distinguished not only for its mastery of the art but for its originality of thought and imagination 
the award seeks to commend strong unique enduring voices that  throughout long consistently accomplished careers  have told us something about the american experience 
in a statement issued in response to the award delillo said when i received news of this award my first thoughts were of my mother and father who came to this country the hard way as young people confronting a new language and culture 
in a significant sense the library of congress prize is the culmination of their efforts and a tribute to their memory 
in november NUM delillo revealed that he was at work on a new novel his sixteenth and that the main character spends a lot of time watching file footage on a wide screen images of a disaster 
in august NUM delillos us publishers simon and schuster announced that his seventeenth novel titled zero k was published in may NUM
the advanced blurb for the novel is as follows

jeffrey lockharts father ross is a george soros-like billionaire now in his sixties with a younger wife artis whose health is failing 
ross is the primary investor in a deeply remote and secret compound where death is controlled and bodies are preserved until a future moment when medicine and technology can reawaken them 
jeffrey joins ross and artis at the compound to say an uncertain farewell to her as she surrenders her body 
ross lockhart is not driven by the hope for immortality for power and wealth beyond the grave 
he is driven by love for his wife for artis without whom he feels life is not worth living 
it is that which compels him to submit to death long before his time 
jeffrey heartily disapproves 
he is committed to living to the mingled astonishments of our time here on earth 
thus begins an emotionally resonant novel that weighs the darkness of the worldterrorism floods fires famine deathagainst the beauty of everyday life love awe the intimate touch of earth and sun 
brilliantly observed and infused with humor don delillos zero k is an acute observation about the fragility and meaning of life about embracing our family this world our language and our humanity 
in november NUM delillo received the NUM medal for distinguished contribution to american letters at the NUMth national book awards ceremony 
the ceremony was held on november NUM in new york city and he was presented his award by pulitzer prize winner jennifer egan a writer profoundly influenced by delillos work 
in his acceptance speech delillo reflected upon his career as a reader as well as a writer recalling examining his personal book collection and feeling a profound sense of personal connection to literature here im not the writer at all im a grateful reader 
when i look at my book shelves i find myself gazing like a museum-goer 
in february NUM delillo was the guest of honor at an academic conference dedicated to his work don delillo fiction rescues history a three-day event held at the sorbonne nouvelle in paris france 
delillo currently lives near new york city in the suburb of bronxville with his wife 
since NUM in addition to his novels and occasional essays delillo has been active as a playwright 
to date delillo has written five major plays the engineer of moonlight NUM the day room NUM valparaiso NUM love lies bleeding NUM and most recently the word for snow NUM
stage adaptations have also been written for delillos novels libra and mao ii
of his work as a playwright delillo has said that he feels his plays are not influenced by the same writers as his novels im not sure who influenced me as a playwright
ive seen some reviews that mention beckett and pinter but i dont know what to say about that 
i dont feel it myself 
delillos work displays elements of both modernism and postmodernism 
though it is worth noting that delillo himself claims not to know if his work is postmodern it is not postmodern
im the last guy to ask 
if i had to classify myself it would be in the long line of modernists from james joyce through william faulkner and so on 
that has always been my model 
he has said the primary influences on his work and development are abstract expressionism foreign films and jazz 
many of delillos books notably white noise satirize academia and explore postmodern themes of rampant consumerism novelty intellectualism underground conspiracies the disintegration and re-integration of the family and the promise of rebirth through violence 
in several of his novels delillo explores the idea of the increasing visibility and effectiveness of terrorists as societal actors and consequently the displacement of what he views to be artists and particularly novelists traditional role in facilitating social discourse players mao ii falling man
another perpetual theme in delillos books is the saturation of mass media and its role in forming simulacra resulting in the removal of an event from its context and the consequent draining of meaning see the highway shooter in underworld the televised disasters longed for in white noise the planes in falling man the evolving story of the interviewee in valparaiso
the psychology of crowds and the capitulation of individuals to group identity is a theme delillo examines in several of his novels especially in the prologue to underworld mao ii and falling man
in a NUM interview with maria nadotti delillo explained

many younger english-language authors such as bret easton ellis jonathan franzen and david foster wallace have cited delillo as an influence 
literary critic harold bloom named him as one of the four major american novelists of his time along with thomas pynchon philip roth and cormac mccarthy though he questions the classification of delillo as a postmodern novelist 
asked if he approves of this designation delillo has responded i dont react 
but id prefer not to be labeled 
im a novelist period 
an american novelist 
critics of delillo argue that his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow 
in james woods review of zadie smiths NUM novel white teeth he dismissed the work of authors like delillo wallace and smith as hysterical realism
bruce bawer famously condemned delillos novels insisting they werent actually novels at all but tracts designed to batter us again and again with a single idea that life in america today is boring benumbing dehumanized ..its better delillo seems to say in one novel after another to be a marauding murderous maniac  and therefore a human  than to sit still for america as it is with its air conditioners assembly lines television sets supermarkets synthetic fabrics and credit cards 
george will proclaimed the study of lee harvey oswald in libra as sandbox existentialism and an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship 
delillo responded i dont take it seriously but being called a bad citizen is a compliment to a novelist at least to my mind 
thats exactly what we ought to do 
we ought to be bad citizens 
we ought to in the sense that were writing against what power represents and often what government represents and what the corporation dictates and what consumer consciousness has come to mean 
in that sense if were bad citizens were doing our job 
in the same interview delillo rejected wills claim that delillo blames america for lee harvey oswald countering that he instead blamed america for george will 
delillo also figured prominently in b r myerss critique of recent american literary fiction a readers manifesto

chabon followed telegraph avenue in november NUM with his latest novel  a fictionalized memoir of his maternal grandfather based upon his deathbed confessions under the influence of powerful painkillers in chabons mothers california home in NUM
chabons work is characterized by complex language the frequent use of metaphor along with recurring themes including nostalgia divorce abandonment fatherhood and most notably issues of jewish identity 
he often includes gay bisexual and jewish characters in his work 
since the late NUMs chabon has written in an increasingly diverse series of styles for varied outlets he is a notable defender of the merits of genre fiction and plot-driven fiction and along with novels he has published screenplays childrens books comics and newspaper serials 
michael chabon pronounced in his words shea as in shea stadium bon as in bon jovi ie   was born in washington dc to robert chabon a physician and lawyer and sharon chabon a lawyer 
chabon said he knew he wanted to be a writer when at the age of ten he wrote his first short story for a class assignment 
when the story received an a chabon recalls i thought to myself thats it 
thats what i want to do 
i can do this 
and i never had any second thoughts or doubts 
referring to popular culture he wrote of being raised on a hearty diet of crap
his parents divorced when chabon was NUM and he grew up in pittsburgh pennsylvania and columbia maryland 
columbia where chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother was a progressive planned living community in which racial economic and religious diversity were actively fostered 
he has written of his mothers marijuana use recalling her sometime around NUM or so sitting in the front seat of her friend kathys car passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie 
he grew up hearing yiddish spoken by his mothers parents and siblings 
chabon attended carnegie mellon university for a year before transferring to the university of pittsburgh where he studied under chuck kinder and received a bachelor of arts in NUM
he then went to graduate school at the university of california irvine where he received a master of fine arts in creative writing 
chabons first novel the mysteries of pittsburgh was written as his uc irvine masters thesis 
without telling chabon his professor donald heiney better known by his pen name macdonald harris sent it to a literary agent who got the author an impressive NUM advance on the novel most first-time novelists receive advances ranging from NUM to NUM.
the mysteries of pittsburgh appeared in NUM and became a bestseller instantly catapulting chabon to the status of literary celebrity 
among chabons major literary influences in this period were donald barthelme jorge luis borges gabriel garca mrquez raymond chandler john updike philip roth and f scott fitzgerald 
as chabon remarked in NUM i just copied the writers whose voices i was responding to and i think thats probably the best way to learn 
chabon was ambivalent about his new-found fame 
he turned down offers to appear in a gap ad and to be featured as one of peoples NUM most beautiful people 
he later said of the people offer i dont give a shit about it  .
i only take pride in things ive actually done myself 
to be praised for something like that is just weird 
it just felt like somebody calling and saying we want to put you in a magazine because the weathers so nice where you live 
in NUM chabon reflected on the success of his first novel by saying that while the upside was that i was published and i got a readership  .. the downside  .. was that emotionally this stuff started happening and i was still like wait a minute is my thesis done yet
it took me a few years to catch up 
in NUM chabon published a model world a collection of short stories many of which had been published previously in the new yorker
after the success of the mysteries of pittsburgh chabon spent five years working on a second novel 
called fountain city the novel was a highly ambitious opus  .. about an architect building a perfect baseball park in florida and it eventually ballooned to NUM pages with no end in sight 
the process was frustrating for chabon who in his words never felt like i was conceptually on steady ground 
at one point chabon submitted a NUM-page draft to his agent and editor who disliked the work 
chabon had problems dropping the novel though 
it was really scary he said later 
id already signed a contract and been paid all this money 
and then id gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife 
my instincts were telling me this book is fucked 
just drop it 
but i didnt because i thought what if i have to give the money back
i used to go down to my office and fantasize about all the books i could write instead 
when he finally decided to abandon fountain city chabon recalls staring at his blank computer for hours before suddenly picturing a straitlaced troubled young man with a tendency toward melodrama trying to end it all 
he began writing and within a couple of days had written NUM pages of what would become his second novel wonder boys
chabon drew on his experiences with fountain city for the character of grady tripp a frustrated novelist who has spent years working on an immense fourth novel 
the author wrote wonder boys in a dizzy seven-month streak without telling his agent or publisher hed abandoned fountain city
the book published in NUM was a commercial and critical success 
in late NUM an annotated four-chapter fragment from the unfinished NUM page manuscript fountain city complete with cautionary introduction and postscript written by chabon was included in mcsweeneys NUM
among the supporters of wonder boys was the washington post critic jonathan yardley however despite declaring chabon the young star of american letters yardley argued that in his works to that point chabon had been preoccupied with fictional explorations of his own  .
it is time for him to move on to break away from the first person and explore larger worlds 
chabon later said that he took yardleys criticism to heart explaining it chimed with my own thoughts 
i had bigger ambitions 
in NUM he published his second collection of short stories werewolves in their youth which included his first published foray into genre fiction the grim horror story in the black mill 
shortly after completing wonder boys chabon discovered a box of comic books from his childhood a reawakened interest in comics coupled with memories of the lore his brooklyn-born father had told him about the middle years of the twentieth century in america 
...the radio shows politicians movies music and athletes and so forth of that era inspired him to begin work on a new novel 
in NUM he published the amazing adventures of kavalier  clay an epic historical novel that charts NUM years in the lives of sammy clay and joe kavalier two jewish cousins who create a wildly popular series of comic books in the early NUMs the years leading up to the entry of the us into world war ii 
the novel received nearly unanimous praise and became a new york times best seller eventually winning the NUM pulitzer prize for fiction 
chabon reflected that in writing kavalier  clay i discovered strengths i had hoped that i possessedthe ability to pull off multiple points of view historical settings the passage of yearsbut which had never been tested before 
in NUM chabon published summerland a fantasy novel written for younger readers that received mixed reviews but sold extremely well and won the NUM mythopoeic fantasy award 
two years later he published the final solution a novella about an investigation led by an unknown old man whom the reader can guess to be sherlock holmes during the final years of world war ii 
his dark horse comics project the amazing adventures of the escapist a quarterly anthology series that was published from NUM to NUM purported to cull stories from an involved fictitious NUM-year history of the escapist character created by the protagonists of the amazing adventures of kavalier  clay
it was awarded the NUM eisner award for best anthology and a pair of harvey awards for best anthology and best new series

during a qa session in january NUM chabon added that he was writing a naturalistic novel about two families in berkeley

telegraph avenue adapted from an idea for a tv series pilot that chabon was asked to write in NUM is a social novel set on the borders between oakland and berkeley in the summer of NUM that sees a large cast of characters grapple with infidelity fatherhood crooked politicians racism nostalgia and buried secrets 
chabon said upon publication in an interview with the san francisco chronicle that the novel concerns the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds heritage and history 
five years in gestation telegraph avenue had a difficult birth chabon telling the guardian newspaper i got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop .
i had to start all over again keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element 
after starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay onward chabon feels that telegraph avenue is a significant unification of his earlier and later styles declaring in an interview i could do whatever i wanted to do in this book and it would be ok even if it verged on crime fiction even if it verged on magic realism even if it verged on martial arts fiction .
i was open to all of that and yet i didnt have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction that that was another genre for me now and i felt free to mix them all in a sense 
the novel has been optioned by film producer scott rudin who previously optioned and produced wonder boys and cameron crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay according to chabon 
in a public lecture and reading of the novel in oakland california chabon listed creative influences as broad as sir arthur conan doyle robert altman and william faulkner 
chabons latest novel moonglow was published november NUM NUM

in an interview with the american booksellers association promoting moonglow in november NUM chabon stated that his next fiction project would be ...a long overdue follow-up  but not a sequel  to summerland my book for a somewhat younger readership 
its something ive been trying to get around to for a long time 
chabon is set to follow-up kingdoms of olives and ash with pops fatherhood in pieces a non-fiction memoiressay collection in may NUM
despite his success chabon continues to perceive himself as a failure noting that anyone who has ever received a bad review knows how it outlasts by decades the memory of a favorable word 
in NUM amazoncom a leading book distributor was in a dispute with hachette a publisher 
hundreds of authors chabon included condemned amazon in an open letter because amazon stopped taking pre-orders for books published by hachette 
after the publication of the mysteries of pittsburgh chabon was mistakenly featured in a newsweek article on up-and-coming gay writers pittsburghs protagonist has liaisons with people of both sexes
the new york times later reported that in some ways chabon was happy for the magazines error and quoted him as saying i feel very lucky about all of that 
it really opened up a new readership to me and a very loyal one 
in a NUM interview chabon added if mysteries of pittsburgh is about anything in terms of human sexuality and identity its that people cant be put into categories all that easily 
in on the mysteries of pittsburgh an essay he wrote for the new york review of books in NUM chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel i had slept with one man whom i loved and learned to love another man so much that it would never have occurred to me to want to sleep with him 
in NUM chabon married the poet lollie groth 
according to chabon the popularity of the mysteries of pittsburgh had adverse effects he later explained i was married at the time to someone else who was also a struggling writer and the success created a gross imbalance in our careers which was problematic 
he and groth divorced in NUM
he married the writer ayelet waldman in NUM
they currently live together in berkeley california with their four children sophie waldman chabon born NUM ezekiel zeke napoleon waldman chabon born NUM ida-rose waldman chabon born june NUM NUM and abraham wolf waldman chabon born march NUM NUM
chabon has said that the creative free-flow he has with waldman inspired the relationship between sammy clay and rosa saks toward the end of the amazing adventures of kavalier  clay and in NUM entertainment weekly declared the couple a famousand famously in lovewriting pair like nick and nora charles with word processors and not so much booze 
in a NUM interview with guy raz of weekend all things considered chabon said that he writes from NUM pm to NUM am each day sunday through thursday 
he tries to write NUM words a day 
commenting on the rigidity of his routine chabon said there have been plenty of self-destructive rebel-angel novelists over the years but writing is about getting your work done and getting your work done every day 
if you want to write novels they take a long time and theyre big and they have a lot of words in them .
the best environment at least for me is a very stable structured kind of life 
chabon was a vocal endorser of barack obama during his NUM election campaign and wrote an enthusiastic opinion piece on obama for the new york review of books titled obama  the conquest of denver in october NUM
subsequently chabon included a brief fictionalized cameo by obama in his NUM novel telegraph avenue
since NUM chabon has been an outspoken critic of donald trump both during his campaign for the presidency signing a petition with over NUM other writers against his presidency in may NUM and during his administration 
during an interview with the guardian before trumps inauguration in january NUM chabon remarked of the incoming president i really have no idea what to expect 
hes so unpredictable 
hes so mercurial 
you know i would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the united states than if he said he was going to take them all out to be shot 
hes like a random impulse generator 
in a NUM radio interview chabon spoke of president trump and said every morning i wake up and in the seconds before i turn my phone on to see what the latest news is i have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that hes going to have a massive stroke and you know be carted out of the white house on a gurney 
in a NUM essay chabon decried the state of modern short fiction including his own saying that with rare exceptions it consisted solely of the contemporary quotidian plotless moment-of-truth revelatory story 
in an apparent reaction against these plotless stories sparkling with epiphanic dew chabons post-NUM work has been marked by an increased interest in genre fiction and plot 
while the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay was like the mysteries of pittsburgh and wonder boys an essentially realistic contemporary novel whose plot happened to revolve around comic-book superheroes chabons subsequent workssuch as the final solution his dabbling with comic-book writing and the swashbuckling adventure of gentlemen of the roadhave been almost exclusively devoted to mixing aspects of genre and literary fiction 
perhaps the most notable example of this is the yiddish policemens union which won five genre awards including the hugo award and nebula award 
chabon seeks to annihilate not the genres themselves but the bias against certain genres of fiction such as fantasy science fiction and romance 
chabons forays into genre fiction have met with mixed critical reaction 
one science fiction short story by chabon the martian agent was described by a reviewer as enough to send readers back into the cold but reliable arms of the new yorker.
another critic wrote of the same story that it was richly plotted action-packed and that chabon skilfully elaborates his world and draws not just on the steampunk worlds of william gibson bruce sterling and michael moorcock but on alternate histories by brilliant science fiction mavericks such as avram davidson and howard waldrop 
the imperial politics are craftily resonant and the story keeps us hanging on 
while the village voice called the final solution an ingenious fully imagined work an expert piece of literary ventriloquism and a mash note to the beloved boys tales of chabons youth the boston globe wrote the genre of the comic book is an anemic vein for novelists to mine lest they squander their brilliance 
the new york times states that the detective story a genre that is by its nature so constrained so untransgressive seems unlikely to appeal to the real writer but adds that ... chabon makes good on his claim a successful detective story need not be lacking in literary merit 
in NUM chabon argued against the idea that genre fiction and entertaining fiction should not appeal to the real writer saying that the common perception is that entertainment  .. means junk .. but maybe the reason for the junkiness of so much of what pretends to entertain us is that we have acceptedindeed we have helped to articulatesuch a narrow debased concept of entertainment .
id like to believe that because i read for entertainment and i write to entertain 
period 
one of the more positive responses to chabons brand of trickster literature appeared in time magazine whose lev grossman wrote that this is literature in mid-transformation .. the highbrow and the lowbrow once kept chastely separate are now hooking up and you can almost see the future of literature coming 
grossman classed chabon with a movement of authors similarly eager to blend literary and popular writing including jonathan lethem with whom chabon is friends margaret atwood and susanna clarke 
on the other hand in slate in NUM ruth franklin said michael chabon has spent considerable energy trying to drag the decaying corpse of genre fiction out of the shallow grave where writers of serious literature abandoned it 
for some of his own genre work chabon has forged an unusual horrorfantasy fiction persona under the name of august van zorn 
more elaborately developed than a pseudonym august van zorn is purported to be a pen name for one albert vetch NUM
in chabons NUM novel wonder boys narrator grady tripp writes that he grew up in the same hotel as vetch who worked as an english professor at the nonexistent coxley college and wrote hundreds of pulp stories that were in the gothic mode after the manner of lovecraft  .. but written in a dry ironic at times almost whimsical idiom 
a horror-themed short story titled in the black mill was published in playboy in june NUM and reprinted in chabons NUM story collection werewolves in their youth and was attributed to van zorn 
chabon has created a comprehensive bibliography for van zorn along with an equally fictional literary scholar devoted to his oeuvre named leon chaim bach 
bachs now-defunct website which existed under the auspices of chabons declared van zorn to be without question the greatest unknown horror writer of the twentieth century and mentioned that bach had once edited a collection of short stories by van zorn titled the abominations of plunkettsburg
the name leon chaim bach is an anagram of michael chabon as is malachi b cohen the name of a fictional comics expert who wrote occasional essays about the escapist for the characters dark horse comic series 
in NUM chabon established the august van zorn prize awarded to the short story that most faithfully and disturbingly embodies the tradition of the weird short story as practiced by edgar allan poe and his literary descendants among them august van zorn 
the first recipient of the prize was jason roberts whose winning story NUMc was then included in mcsweeneys enchanted chamber of astonishing stories edited by chabon 
a scene in the film adaptation of chabons novel the mysteries of pittsburgh shows two characters in a bookstore stocking august van zorn books 
chabon has provided several subtle hints throughout his work that the stories he tells take place in a shared fictional universe 
one recurring character who is mentioned in three of chabons books but never actually appears is eli drinkwater a fictional catcher for the pittsburgh pirates who died abruptly after crashing his car on mt 
nebo road 
the most detailed exposition of drinkwaters life appears in chabons NUM short story smoke which is set at drinkwaters funeral and refers to him as a scholarly catcher a redoubtable batsman and a kind affectionate person 
drinkwater was again referred to though not by name in chabons NUM novel wonder boys in which narrator grady tripp explains that his sportswriter friend happy blackmore was hired to ghost the autobiography of a catcher a rising star who played for pittsburgh and hit the sort of home runs that linger in the memory for years 
tripp explains that blackmore turned in an inadequate draft his book contract was cancelled and the catcher died shortly afterwards leaving nothing in happys notorious files but the fragments and scribblings of a ghost 
in chabons childrens book summerland NUM it is suggested that blackmore was eventually able to find a publisher for the biography the character jennifer t mentions that she has read a book called eli drinkwater a life in baseball written by happy blackmore 
drinkwaters name may have been selected in homage to contemporary author john crowley whom chabon is on the record as admiring 
crowleys novel little big featured a main character named alice drinkwater 
there are also instances in which character surnames reappear from story to story 
cleveland arning a character in chabons NUM debut novel the mysteries of pittsburgh is described as having come from a wealthy family one that might be expected to be able to endow a building 
near the end of wonder boys NUM it is mentioned that on the unnamed college campus at which grady tripp teaches there is a building called arning hall where the english faculty kept office hours 
similarly in chabons NUM short story a model world a character named levine discovers or rather plagiarizes a formula for nephokinesis or cloud control that wins him respect and prominence in the meteorological field 
in the amazing adventures of kavalier  clay NUM a passing reference is made to the massive levine school of applied meteorology ostensibly a building owned by new york university 
although chabon has described his attitude toward hollywood as pre-emptive cynicism for years the author has nevertheless engaged in sustained and often fruitless efforts to bring both adapted and original projects to the screen 
in NUM chabon pitched a screenplay entitled the gentleman host to producer scott rudin a romantic comedy about old jewish folks on a third-rate cruise ship out of miami 
rudin bought the project and developed it with chabon but it was never filmed partly due to the release of the similarly themed film out to sea in NUM
in the nineties chabon also pitched story ideas for both the x-men and the fantastic four movies but was rejected 
when scott rudin was adapting wonder boys for the screen the author declined an offer to write the screenplay saying he was too busy writing the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay
directed by curtis hanson and starring michael douglas wonder boys was released in NUM to critical acclaim and financial failure 
having bought the film rights to the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay rudin then asked chabon to work on that films screenplay 
although chabon spent NUM months in NUM and NUM working on the novels film adaptation the project has been mired in pre-production for years 
chabons work however remains popular in hollywood with rudin purchasing the film rights to the yiddish policemens union then titled hatzeplatz in NUM five years before the book would be published 
the same year miramax bought the rights to summerland and tales of mystery and imagination a planned collection of eight genre short stories that chabon has not yet written each of which was optioned for a sum in the mid-six figures 
chabon also wrote a draft for NUMs spider-man NUM about a third of which was used in the final film 
soon after spider-man NUM was released director sam raimi mentioned that he hoped to hire chabon to work on the films sequel if i can get him but chabon never worked on spider-man NUM
in october NUM it was announced that chabon was at work writing disneys snow and the seven a live-action martial arts retelling of snow white and the seven dwarfs to be directed by master hong kong fight choreographer and director yuen wo ping 
in august NUM chabon said that he had been replaced on snow sarcastically explaining that the producers wanted to go in more of a fun direction 
although chabon was uninvolved with the project director rawson marshall thurber shot a film adaptation of the mysteries of pittsburgh in fall NUM
the film which stars sienna miller and peter sarsgaard was released in april NUM
in february NUM scott rudin reported that a film adaptation of the yiddish policemens union was in pre-production to be written and directed by the coen brothers 
in april NUM chabon confirmed he had been hired to do revisions to the script for disneys john carter
in NUM chabon was also involved in writing lyrics for mark ronsons album uptown special
in july NUM chabon was hired to do revisions to the script for disneys bob the musical
philip roth

philip milton roth born march NUM NUM is an american novelist 
he first gained attention with the NUM novella goodbye columbus an irreverent and humorous portrait of american jewish life for which he received the us national book award for fiction 
roths fiction regularly set in his birthplace of newark new jersey is known for its intensely autobiographical character for philosophically and formally blurring the distinction between reality and fiction for its supple ingenious style and for its provocative explorations of jewish and american identity 
his profile rose significantly in NUM after the publication of portnoys complaint the humorous and sexually explicit psychoanalytical monologue of a lust-ridden mother-addicted young jewish bachelor filled with intimate shameful detail and coarse abusive language 
roth is one of the most awarded american writers of his generation 
his books have twice received the national book award and the national book critics circle award and three times the penfaulkner award

in NUM in prague roth received the inaugural franz kafka prize 
philip roth was born in newark new jersey and grew up in its weequahic neighborhood 
he is the second child of
bess ne finkel and herman roth an insurance broker 
roths family was jewish and his parents were first-generation americans whose families were from galicia 
he graduated from newarks weequahic high school in or around NUM
it has provided the focus for the fiction of philip roth the novelist who evokes his era at weequahic high school in the highly acclaimed portnoys complaint..
besides identifying weequahic high school by name the novel specifies such sites as the empire burlesque the weequahic diner the newark museum and irvington park all local landmarks that helped shape the youth of the real roth and the fictional portnoy both graduates of weequahic class of NUM.
the weequahic yearbook NUM describes roth as a boy of real intelligence combined with wit and common sense 
roth was known as a comedian during his time at school 
roth attended bucknell university where he earned a ba  magna cum laude in english and was elected to phi beta kappa 
he pursued graduate studies at the university of chicago where he received an ma 
in english literature in NUM and worked briefly as an instructor in the universitys writing program 
roth taught creative writing at the university of iowa and princeton university 
he continued his academic career at the university of pennsylvania where he taught comparative literature before retiring from teaching in NUM
while at chicago roth met the novelist saul bellow as well as margaret martinson in NUM who became his first wife in NUM
their separation in NUM along with martinsons death in a car crash in NUM left a lasting mark on roths literary output 
specifically martinson was the inspiration for female characters in several of roths novels including lucy nelson in when she was good and maureen tarnopol in my life as a man 
between the end of his studies and the publication of his first book in NUM roth served two years in the united states army and then wrote short fiction and criticism for various magazines including movie reviews for the new republic 
events in roths personal life have occasionally been the subject of media scrutiny 
a post-operative breakdown mentioned in the pseudo-confessional novel operation shylock NUM and others drew on roths experience of the temporary side effects of the sedative halcion triazolam prescribed post-operatively in the NUMs 
it was subsequently discovered that unfavorable studies had been suppressed by triazolams manufacturer upjohn which showed the drug carried a high risk of causing short-term psychiatric disturbance 
when this became known the drug was banned in some countries and its withdrawal due to high risk and poor clinical benefit was also discussed in the united states 
roth is an atheist who has said when the whole world doesnt believe in god itll be a great place 
he also said during an interview to the guardian im exactly the opposite of religious im anti-religious 
i find religious people hideous 
i hate the religious lies 
its all a big lie and its not a neurotic thing but the miserable record of religioni dont even want to talk about it 
its not interesting to talk about the sheep referred to as believers 
when i write im alone 
its filled with fear and loneliness and anxietyand i never needed religion to save me 
in NUM roth married his longtime companion english actress claire bloom 
in NUM they separated and in NUM bloom published a memoir  that described the couples marriage in detail much of which was unflattering to roth 
certain aspects of i married a communist have been regarded by critics as veiled rebuttals to the accusations in blooms memoir 
roths work first appeared in print in chicago review when he was studying and later teaching at the university of chicago 
his first book goodbye columbus and five short stories won the national book award in NUM and afterwards he published two novels letting go and when she was good
the publication of his fourth novel portnoys complaint in NUM gave roth widespread commercial and critical success 
during the NUMs roth experimented in various modes from the political satire our gang to the kafkaesque the breast
by the end of the decade roth had created his alter ego nathan zuckerman 
in a series of highly self-referential novels and novellas that followed between NUM and NUM zuckerman appeared as either the main character or an interlocutor 
sabbaths theater NUM may have roths most lecherous protagonist mickey sabbath a disgraced former puppeteer it won his second national book award 
in complete contrast american pastoral NUM the first volume of his so-called second zuckerman trilogy focuses on the life of virtuous newark star athlete swede levov and the tragedy that befalls him when levovs teenage daughter becomes a domestic terrorist during the late NUMs it won the pulitzer prize for fiction 
i married a communist NUM focuses on the mccarthy era 
the human stain examines identity politics in NUMs america 
the dying animal NUM is a short novel about eros and death that revisits literary professor david kepesh protagonist of two NUMs works the breast and the professor of desire
in the plot against america NUM roth imagines an alternative american history in which charles lindbergh aviator hero and isolationist is elected us president in NUM and the us negotiates an understanding with hitlers nazi germany and embarks on its own program of anti-semitism 
roths novel everyman a meditation on illness aging desire and death was published in may NUM
for everyman roth won his third penfaulkner award making him the only person so honored 
exit ghost which again features nathan zuckerman was released in october NUM
it was the last zuckerman novel 
indignation roths NUMth book was published on september NUM NUM
set in NUM during the korean war it follows marcus messners departure from newark to ohios winesburg college where he begins his sophomore year 
in NUM roths NUMth book the humbling was published 
it tells the story of the last performances of simon axler a celebrated stage actor 
roths NUMst book nemesis was published on october NUM NUM
according to the books notes nemesis is the last in a series of four short novels after everyman indignation and the humbling
in october NUM during an interview with tina brown of the daily beast to promote the humbling roth considered the future of literature and its place in society stating his belief that within NUM years the reading of novels will be regarded as a cultic activity

i was being optimistic about NUM years really 
i think its going to be cultic 
i think always people will be reading them but it will be a small group of people 
maybe more people than now read latin poetry but somewhere in that range 
... to read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration focus devotion to the reading 
if you read a novel in more than two weeks you dont read the novel really 
so i think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come byits hard to find huge numbers of people large numbers of people significant numbers of people who have those qualities.
when asked about the prospect of digital books and e-books possibly replacing printed copy roth was equally downbeat

the book cant compete with the screen 
it couldnt compete in the beginning with the movie screen 
it couldnt compete with the television screen and it cant compete with the computer screen 
... now we have all those screens so against all those screens a book couldnt measure up 
the interview was not the first time roth had expressed pessimism about the future of the novel and its significance in recent years 
talking to the observers robert mccrum in NUM he said im not good at finding encouraging features in american culture 
i doubt that aesthetic literacy has much of a future here 
in an october NUM interview with the french magazine les inrockuptibles roth announced that he would be retiring from writing and confirmed subsequently in le monde that he would no longer publish fiction 
in may NUM roth claimed in an interview with alan yentob for the bbc that this is my last appearance on television my absolutely last appearance on any stage anywhere 
much of roths fiction revolves around semi-autobiographical themes while self-consciously and playfully addressing the perils of establishing connections between roth and his fictional lives and voices 
examples of this close relationship between the authors life and his characters include narrators and protagonists such as david kepesh and nathan zuckerman as well as the character philip roth who appears in the plot against america and of whom there are two in operation shylock
critic jacques berlinerblau noted in the chronicle of higher education that these fictional voices create a complex and tricky experience for readers deceiving them into believing they know roth 
in roths fiction the question of authorship is intertwined with the theme of the idealistic secular jewish son who attempts to distance himself from jewish customs and traditions and from what he perceives as the sometimes suffocating influence of parents rabbis and other community leaders 
roths fiction has been described by critics as pervaded by a kind of alienation that is enlivened and exacerbated by what binds it
roths first work goodbye columbus was an irreverently humorous depiction of the life of middle-class jewish americans and met controversy among reviewers who were highly polarized in their judgments one criticized it as infused with a sense of self-loathing 
in response roth in his NUM essay writing about jews collected in reading myself and others maintained that he wanted to explore the conflict between the call to jewish solidarity and his desire to be free to question the values and morals of middle-class jewish americans uncertain of their identities in an era of cultural assimilation and upward social mobility
the cry watch out for the goyim
at times seems more the expression of an unconscious wish than of a warning oh that they were out there so that we could be together here
a rumor of persecution a taste of exile might even bring with it the old world of feelings and habitssomething to replace the new world of social accessibility and moral indifference the world which tempts all our promiscuous instincts and where one cannot always figure out what a jew is that a christian is not 
in roths fiction the exploration of promiscuous instincts within the context of jewish lives mainly from a male viewpoint plays an important role 
in the words of critic hermione lee
philip roths fiction strains to shed the burden of jewish traditions and proscriptions 
..
the liberated jewish consciousness let loose into the disintegration of the american dream finds itself deracinated and homeless 
american society and politics by the late sixties are a grotesque travesty of what jewish immigrants had traveled towards liberty peace security a decent liberal democracy 
while roths fiction has strong autobiographical influences it has also incorporated social commentary and political satire most obviously in our gang and operation shylock
since the NUMs roths fiction has often combined autobiographical elements with retrospective dramatizations of postwar american life 
roth has described american pastoral and the two following novels as a loosely connected american trilogy
each of these novels treats aspects of the postwar era against the backdrop of the nostalgically remembered jewish-american childhood of nathan zuckerman in which the experience of life on the american home front during the second world war features prominently 
in much of roths fiction the NUMs comprising roths and zuckermans childhood mark a high point of american idealism and social cohesion 
a more satirical treatment of the patriotism and idealism of the war years is evident in roths comic novels such as portnoys complaint and sabbaths theater
in the plot against america the alternate history of the war years dramatizes the prevalence of anti-semitism and racism in america at the time despite the promotion of increasingly influential anti-racist ideals during the war 
in his fiction roth portrayed the NUMs and the new deal era of the NUMs that preceded it as a heroic phase in american history 
a sense of frustration with social and political developments in the us since the NUMs is palpable in the american trilogy and exit ghost but had already been present in roths earlier works that contained political and social satire such as our gang and the great american novel
writing about the latter hermione lee points to the sense of disillusionment with the american dream in roths fiction the mythic words on which roths generation was brought upwinning patriotism gamesmanshipare desanctified greed fear racism and political ambition are disclosed as the motive forces behind the all-american ideals.
two of roths works have won the national book award for fiction four others were finalists 
two have won national book critics circle awards again another five were finalists 
he has also won three penfaulkner awards operation shylock the human stain and everyman and a pulitzer prize for his NUM novel american pastoral
in NUM the human stain was awarded the united kingdoms wh smith literary award for the best book of the year 
in NUM he was awarded the national book foundation medal for distinguished contribution to american letters 
literary critic harold bloom has named him as one of the four major american novelists still at work along with thomas pynchon don delillo and cormac mccarthy 
his NUM novel the plot against america won the sidewise award for alternate history in NUM as well as the society of american historians james fenimore cooper prize 
roth was also awarded the united kingdoms wh smith literary award for the best book of the year an award roth has received twice 
he was honored in his hometown in october NUM when then-mayor sharpe james presided over the unveiling of a street sign in roths name on the corner of summit and keer avenues where roth lived for much of his childhood a setting prominent in the plot against america
a plaque on the house where the roths lived was also unveiled 
in may NUM he was given the pennabokov award and in NUM he was awarded the penfaulkner award for everyman making him the awards only three-time winner 
in april NUM he was chosen as the recipient of the first pensaul bellow award for achievement in american fiction 
the may NUM NUM issue of the new york times book review announced the results of a letter that was sent to what the publication described as a couple of hundred prominent writers critics editors and other literary sages asking them to please identify the single best work of american fiction published in the last NUM years 
six of roths novels were among the NUM selected american pastoral the counterlife operation shylock sabbaths theater the human stain and the plot against america 
the accompanying essay written by critic ao 
scott stated if we had asked for the single best writer of fiction of the past NUM years roth would have won 
in NUM he was awarded the welt-literaturpreis of the german newspaper die welt
roth was awarded the NUMnd edward macdowell medal by the macdowell colony in NUM
roth was awarded the NUM national humanities medal by us president barack obama in the east room of the white house on march NUM NUM
in may NUM roth was awarded the man booker international prize for lifetime achievement in fiction on the world stage the fourth winner of the biennial prize 
one of the judges carmen callil a publisher of the feminist virago house withdrew in protest referring to roths work as emperors clothes
she said he goes on and on and on about the same subject in almost every single book 
its as though hes sitting on your face and you cant breathe  .
i dont rate him as a writer at all  ..
observers quickly noted that callil had a conflict of interest having published a book by claire bloom roths ex-wife that criticized roth and lambasted their marriage 
in response one of the two other booker judges rick gekoski remarked
in NUM he writes goodbye columbus and its a masterpiece magnificent 
fifty-one years later hes NUM years old and he writes nemesis and it is so wonderful such a terrific novel  .. tell me one other writer who NUM years apart writes masterpieces  .
if you look at the trajectory of the average novel writer there is a learning period then a period of high achievement then the talent runs out and in middle age they start slowly to decline 
people say why arent martin amis and julian barnes getting on the booker prize shortlist but thats what happens in middle age

pilot was the grandest position of all 
the pilot even in those days of trivial wages had a princely salary  from a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month and no board to pay 
as twain describes it the pilots prestige exceeded that of the captain 
the pilot had to
get up a warm personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cottonwood and every obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve hundred miles and more than that must actually know where these things are in the dark
steamboat pilot horace e bixby took twain on as a cub pilot to teach him the river between new orleans and st louis for NUM payable out of twains first wages after graduating

in fall NUM he began a friendship with financier henry huttleston rogers a principal of standard oil that lasted the remainder of his life 
rogers first made him file for bankruptcy in april NUM then had him transfer the copyrights on his written works to his wife to prevent creditors from gaining possession of them 
finally rogers took absolute charge of twains money until all his creditors were paid 
twain accepted an offer from robert sparrow smythe and embarked on a year-long around the world lecture tour in july NUM to pay off his creditors in full although he was no longer under any legal obligation to do so

the reason for the toronto visits was to secure canadian and british copyrights for his upcoming book adventures of huckleberry finn to which he had alluded in his montreal visit 
the reason for the ottawa visit had been to secure canadian and british copyrights for life on the mississippi
publishers in toronto had printed unauthorized editions of his books at the time before an international copyright agreement was established in NUM
these were sold in the united states as well as in canada depriving him of royalties 
he estimated that belford brothers edition of the adventures of tom sawyer alone had cost him ten thousand dollars 
he had unsuccessfully attempted to secure the rights for the prince and the pauper in NUM in conjunction with his montreal trip 
eventually he received legal advice to register a copyright in canada for both canada and britain prior to publishing in the united states which would restrain the canadian publishers from printing a version when the american edition was published

there is also a smaller headstone 
he expressed a preference for cremation for example in life on the mississippi but he acknowledged that his surviving family would have the last word 
officials in connecticut and new york estimated the value of twains estate at NUM  today
twain began his career writing light humorous verse but he became a chronicler of the vanities hypocrisies and murderous acts of mankind 
at mid-career he combined rich humor sturdy narrative and social criticism in huckleberry finn
he was a master of rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive american literature built on american themes and language 
many of his works have been suppressed at times for various reasons 
the adventures of huckleberry finn has been repeatedly restricted in american high schools not least for its frequent use of the word nigger which was in common usage in the pre-civil war period in which the novel was set 
a complete bibliography of twains works is nearly impossible to compile because of the vast number of pieces he wrote often in obscure newspapers and his use of several different pen names 
additionally a large portion of his speeches and lectures have been lost or were not recorded thus the compilation of twains works is an ongoing process 
researchers rediscovered published material as recently as NUM and NUM
twain was writing for the virginia city newspaper the territorial enterprise in NUM when he met lawyer tom fitch editor of the competing newspaper virginia daily union and known as the silver-tongued orator of the pacific
he credited fitch with giving him his first really profitable lesson in writing 
when i first began to lecture and in my earlier writings twain later commented my sole idea was to make comic capital out of everything i saw and heard 
in NUM he presented his lecture on the sandwich islands to a crowd in washoe city nevada 
afterwards fitch told him
clemens your lecture was magnificent 
it was eloquent moving sincere 
never in my entire life have i listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration 
but you committed one unpardonable sin the unpardonable sin 
it is a sin you must never commit again 
you closed a most eloquent description by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really fine effect you had produced 
it was in these days that twain became a writer of the sagebrush school he was known later as the most notable within the genre 
his first important work was the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county published in the new york saturday press on november NUM NUM
after a burst of popularity the sacramento union commissioned him to write letters about his travel experiences 
the first journey that he took for this job was to ride the steamer ajax on its maiden voyage to the sandwich islands hawaii
all the while he was writing letters to the newspaper that were meant for publishing chronicling his experiences with humor 
these letters proved to be the genesis to his work with the san francisco alta california newspaper which designated him a traveling correspondent for a trip from san francisco to new york city via the panama isthmus 
twains next work drew on his experiences on the mississippi river 
old times on the mississippi was a series of sketches published in the atlantic monthly in NUM featuring his disillusionment with romanticism 
old times eventually became the starting point for life on the mississippi
twains next major publication was the adventures of tom sawyer which draws on his youth in hannibal 
tom sawyer was modeled on twain as a child with traces of schoolmates john briggs and will bowen 
the book also introduces huckleberry finn in a supporting role based on twains boyhood friend tom blankenship 
the prince and the pauper was not as well received despite a storyline that is common in film and literature today 
the book tells the story of two boys born on the same day who are physically identical acting as a social commentary as the prince and pauper switch places 
twain had started adventures of huckleberry finn which he consistently had problems completing and had completed his travel book a tramp abroad which describes his travels through central and southern europe 
twains next major published work was the adventures of huckleberry finn which confirmed him as a noteworthy american writer 
some have called it the first great american novel and the book has become required reading in many schools throughout the united states 
huckleberry finn was an offshoot from tom sawyer and had a more serious tone than its predecessor 
four hundred manuscript pages were written in mid-NUM right after the publication of tom sawyer
the last fifth of huckleberry finn is subject to much controversy 
some say that twain experienced a failure of nerve as critic leo marx puts it 
ernest hemingway once said of huckleberry finn

if you read it you must stop where the nigger jim is stolen from the boys 
that is the real end 
the rest is just cheating 
hemingway also wrote in the same essay

all modern american literature comes from one book by mark twain called huckleberry finn
near the completion of huckleberry finn twain wrote life on the mississippi which is said to have heavily influenced the novel 
the travel work recounts twains memories and new experiences after a NUM-year absence from the mississippi river 
in it he also explains that mark twain was the call made when the boat was in safe water indicating a depth of two fathoms 
twain produced president ulysses s grants memoirs through his fledgling publishing house charles l webster  company which he co-owned with charles l webster his nephew by marriage 
at this time he also wrote the private history of a campaign that failed for the century magazine
this piece detailed his two-week stint in a confederate militia during the civil war 
he next focused on a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court written with the same historical fiction style as the prince and the pauper
a connecticut yankee showed the absurdities of political and social norms by setting them in the court of king arthur 
the book was started in december NUM then shelved a few months later until the summer of NUM and eventually finished in the spring of NUM
his next large-scale work was puddnhead wilson which he wrote rapidly as he was desperately trying to stave off bankruptcy 
from november NUM to december NUM NUM twain wrote NUM words for the novel 
critics have pointed to this rushed completion as the cause of the novels rough organization and constant disruption of the plot 
this novel also contains the tale of two boys born on the same day who switch positions in life like the prince and the pauper
it was first published serially in century magazine and when it was finally published in book form puddnhead wilson appeared as the main title however the subtitles make the entire title read the tragedy of puddnhead wilson and the comedy of the extraordinary twins
twains next venture was a work of straight fiction that he called personal recollections of joan of arc and dedicated to his wife 
he had long said that this was the work that he was most proud of despite the criticism that he received for it 
the book had been a dream of his since childhood and he claimed that he had found a manuscript detailing the life of joan of arc when he was an adolescent 
this was another piece that he was convinced would save his publishing company 
his financial adviser henry huttleston rogers quashed that idea and got twain out of that business altogether but the book was published nonetheless 
to pay the bills and keep his business projects afloat twain had begun to write articles and commentary furiously with diminishing returns but it was not enough 
he filed for bankruptcy in NUM
during this time of dire financial straits he published several literary reviews in newspapers to help make ends meet 
he famously derided james fenimore cooper in his article detailing coopers literary offenses
he became an extremely outspoken critic of other authors and other critics he suggested that before praising coopers work thomas lounsbury brander matthews and wilkie collins ought to have read some of it
george eliot jane austen and robert louis stevenson also fell under twains attack during this time period beginning around NUM and continuing until his death 
he outlines what he considers to be quality writing in several letters and essays in addition to providing a source for the tooth and claw style of literary criticism 
he places emphasis on concision utility of word choice and realism he complains for example that coopers deerslayer purports to be realistic but has several shortcomings 
ironically several of his own works were later criticized for lack of continuity adventures of huckleberry finn and organization puddnhead wilson
twains wife died in NUM while the couple were staying at the villa di quarto in florence 
after some time had passed he published some works that his wife his de facto editor and censor throughout her married life had looked down upon 
the mysterious stranger is perhaps the best known depicting various visits of satan to earth 
this particular work was not published in twains lifetime 
his manuscripts included three versions written between NUM and NUM the so-called hannibal eseldorf and print shop versions 
the resulting confusion led to extensive publication of a jumbled version and only recently have the original versions become available as twain wrote them 
twains last work was his autobiography which he dictated and thought would be most entertaining if he went off on whims and tangents in non-chronological order 
some archivists and compilers have rearranged the biography into a more conventional form thereby eliminating some of twains humor and the flow of the book 
the first volume of the autobiography over NUMpages was published by the university of california in november NUM NUMyears after his death as twain wished 
it soon became an unexpected best seller making twain one of a very few authors publishing new best-selling volumes in the NUMth NUMth and NUMst centuries 
twains works have been subjected to censorship efforts 
according to stuart NUM leading these banning campaigns generally were religious organizations or individuals in positions of influence  not so much working librarians who had been instilled with that american library spirit which honored intellectual freedom within bounds of course
in NUM the brooklyn public library banned both the adventures of huckleberry finn and the adventures of tom sawyer from the childrens department because of their language 
twains views became more radical as he grew older 
in a letter to friend and fellow writer william dean howells in NUM he acknowledged that his views had changed and developed over his lifetime referring to one of his favorite works
before NUM twain was an ardent imperialist 
in the late NUMs and early NUMs he spoke out strongly in favor of american interests in the hawaiian islands 
he said the war with spain in NUM was the worthiest war ever fought 
in NUM however he reversed course 
in the new york herald october NUM NUM twain describes his transformation and political awakening in the context of the philippineamerican war to anti-imperialism

during the boxer rebellion mark twain said that the boxer is a patriot 
he loves his country better than he does the countries of other people 
i wish him success 
from NUM soon after his return from europe until his death in NUM twain was vice-president of the american anti-imperialist league which opposed the annexation of the philippines by the united states and had tens of thousands of members
he wrote many political pamphlets for the organization 
the incident in the philippines posthumously published in NUM was in response to the moro crater massacre in which six hundred moros were killed 
many of his neglected and previously uncollected writings on anti-imperialism appeared for the first time in book form in NUM

he was highly critical of european imperialists notably cecil rhodes who greatly expanded the british empire and leopold ii king of the belgians 
king leopolds soliloquy is a stinging political satire about his private colony the congo free state 
reports of outrageous exploitation and grotesque abuses led to widespread international protest in the early NUMs arguably the first large-scale human rights movement 
in the soliloquy the king argues that bringing christianity to the country outweighs a little starvation 
leopolds rubber gatherers were tortured maimed and slaughtered until the movement forced brussels to call a halt 
during the philippineamerican war twain wrote a short pacifist story titled the war prayer which makes the point that humanism and christianitys preaching of love are incompatible with the conduct of war 
it was submitted to harpers bazaar for publication but on march NUM NUM the magazine rejected the story as not quite suited to a womans magazine
eight days later twain wrote to his friend daniel carter beard to whom he had read the story i dont think the prayer will be published in my time 
none but the dead are permitted to tell the truth 
because he had an exclusive contract with harper  brothers twain could not publish the war prayer elsewhere it remained unpublished until NUM
it was republished as campaigning material by vietnam war protesters 
twain acknowledged that he had originally sympathized with the more moderate girondins of the french revolution and then shifted his sympathies to the more radical sansculottes indeed identifying himself as a marat
twain supported the revolutionaries in russia against the reformists arguing that the tsar must be got rid of by violent means because peaceful ones would not work 
he summed up his views of revolutions in the following statement
twain was an adamant supporter of the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of slaves even going so far as to say lincolns proclamation .. not only set the black slaves free but set the white man free also
he argued that non-whites did not receive justice in the united states once saying i have seen chinamen abused and maltreated in all the mean cowardly ways possible to the invention of a degraded nature .. but i never saw a chinaman righted in a court of justice for wrongs thus done to him
he paid for at least one black person to attend yale law school and for another black person to attend a southern university to become a minister 
twains sympathetic views on race were not reflected in his early writings on american indians 
of them twain wrote in NUM 

as counterpoint twains essay on the literary offenses of fenimore cooper offers a much kinder view of indians 
no other indians would have noticed these things but coopers indians never notice anything 
cooper thinks they are marvelous creatures for noticing but he was almost always in error about his indians 
there was seldom a sane one among them 
in his later travelogue following the equator NUM twain observes that in colonized lands all over the world savages have always been wronged by whites in the most merciless ways such as robbery humiliation and slow slow murder through poverty and the white mans whiskey his conclusion is that there are many humorous things in this world among them the white mans notion that he is less savage than the other savages
in an expression that captures his east indian experiences he wrote so far as i am able to judge nothing has been left undone either by man or nature to make india the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds 
where every prospect pleases and only man is vile 
twain was also a staunch supporter of womens rights and an active campaigner for womens suffrage 
his votes for women speech in which he pressed for the granting of voting rights to women is considered one of the most famous in history 
helen keller benefited from twains support as she pursued her college education and publishing despite her disabilities and financial limitations 
twain wrote glowingly about unions in the river boating industry in life on the mississippi which was read in union halls decades later 
he supported the labor movement especially one of the most important unions the knights of labor 
in a speech to them he said

twain was a presbyterian 
he was critical of organized religion and certain elements of christianity through his later life 
he wrote for example faith is believing what you know aint so and if christ were here now there is one thing he would not be a christian
with anti-catholic sentiment rampant in NUMth century america twain noted he was educated to enmity toward everything that is catholic
as an adult he engaged in religious discussions and attended services his theology developing as he wrestled with the deaths of loved ones and with his own mortality 
twain generally avoided publishing his most controversial opinions on religion in his lifetime and they are known from essays and stories that were published later 
in the essay three statements of the eighties in the NUMs twain stated that he believed in an almighty god but not in any messages revelations holy scriptures such as the bible providence or retribution in the afterlife 
he did state that the goodness the justice and the mercy of god are manifested in his works but also that the universe is governed by strict and immutable laws which determine small matters such as who dies in a pestilence 
at other times he wrote or spoke in ways that contradicted a strict deist view for example plainly professing a belief in providence 
in some later writings in the NUMs he was less optimistic about the goodness of god observing that if our maker is all-powerful for good or evil he is not in his right mind
at other times he conjectured sardonically that perhaps god had created the world with all its tortures for some purpose of his own but was otherwise indifferent to humanity which was too petty and insignificant to deserve his attention anyway 
in NUM twain criticized the actions of the missionary dr william scott ament NUM because ament and other missionaries had collected indemnities from chinese subjects in the aftermath of the boxer uprising of NUM
twains response to hearing of aments methods was published in the north american review in february NUM to the person sitting in darkness and deals with examples of imperialism in china south africa and with the us occupation of the philippines 
a subsequent article to my missionary critics published in the north american review in april NUM unapologetically continues his attack but with the focus shifted from ament to his missionary superiors the american board of commissioners for foreign missions 
after his death twains family suppressed some of his work that was especially irreverent toward conventional religion notably letters from the earth which was not published until his daughter clara reversed her position in NUM in response to soviet propaganda about the withholding 
the anti-religious the mysterious stranger was published in NUM
little bessie a story ridiculing christianity was first published in the NUM collection mark twains fables of man
he raised money to build a presbyterian church in nevada in NUM
twain created a reverent portrayal of joan of arc a subject over which he had obsessed for forty years studied for a dozen years and spent two years writing about 
in NUM and again in NUM he stated i like joan of arc best of all my books it is the best
those who knew twain well late in life recount that he dwelt on the subject of the afterlife his daughter clara saying sometimes he believed death ended everything but most of the time he felt sure of a life beyond 
twains frankest views on religion appeared in his final work autobiography of mark twain the publication of which started in november NUM NUM years after his death 
in it he said

twain was a freemason 
he belonged to polar star lodge no 
NUM af am  based in st louis 
he was initiated an entered apprentice on may NUM NUM passed to the degree of fellow craft on june NUM and raised to the degree of master mason on july NUM
twain visited salt lake city for two days and met there members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints 
they also gave him a book of mormon 
he later wrote in roughing it about that book

twain was opposed to the vivisection practices of his day 
his objection was not on a scientific basis but rather an ethical one 
he specifically cited the pain caused to the animal as his basis of his opposition 
i am not interested to know whether vivisection produces results that are profitable to the human race or doesnt ..
the pains which it inflicts upon unconsenting animals is the basis of my enmity towards it and it is to me sufficient justification of the enmity without looking further 
twain used different pen names before deciding on mark twain
he signed humorous and imaginative sketches as josh until NUM
additionally he used the pen name thomas jefferson snodgrass for a series of humorous letters 
he maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on mississippi riverboats where two fathoms a depth indicating water safe for the passage of boat was a measure on the sounding line 
twain is an archaic term for two as in the veil of the temple was rent in twain 
the riverboatmans cry was mark twain or more fully by the mark twain meaning according to the mark on the line the depth is two fathoms that is the water is deep and it is safe to pass 
twain claimed that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention 
in life on the mississippi he wrote
captain isaiah sellers was not of literary turn or capacity but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river and sign them mark twain and give them to the new orleans picayune
they related to the stage and condition of the river and were accurate and valuable... at the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death i was on the pacific coast 
i was a fresh new journalist and needed a nom de guerre so i confiscated the ancient mariners discarded one and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth how i have succeeded it would not be modest in me to say 
twains story about his pen name has been questioned by some with the suggestion that mark twain refers to a running bar tab that twain would regularly incur while drinking at john pipers saloon in virginia city nevada 
samuel clemens himself responded to this suggestion by saying mark twain was the nom de plume of one captain isaiah sellers who used to write river news over it for the new orleans picayune 
he died in NUM and as he could no longer need that signature i laid violent hands upon it without asking permission of the proprietors remains 
that is the history of the nom de plume i bear 
in his autobiography twain writes further of captain sellers use of mark twain i was a cub pilot on the mississippi river then and one day i wrote a rude and crude satire which was leveled at captain isaiah sellers the oldest steamboat pilot on the mississippi river and the most respected esteemed and revered 
for many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning the river and the changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years and had signed these paragraphs mark twain and published them in the st louis and new orleans journals 
in my satire i made rude game of his reminiscences 
it was a shabby poor performance but i didnt know it and the pilots didnt know it 
the pilots thought it was brilliant 
they were jealous of sellers because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick 
however i have told all about this in old times on the mississippi 
the pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter and it was published in the new orleans true delta 
that poor old captain sellers was deeply wounded 
he had never been held up to ridicule before he was sensitive and he never got over the hurt which i had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity 
i was proud of my performance for a while and considered it quite wonderful but i have changed my opinion of it long ago 
sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again 
while twain is often depicted wearing a white suit modern representations suggesting that he wore them throughout his life are unfounded 
evidence suggests that twain began wearing white suits on the lecture circuit after the death of his wife olivia livy in NUM
however there is also evidence showing him wearing a white suit before NUM
in NUM he sent a photograph of himself in a white suit to NUM-year-old edward w bok later publisher of the ladies home journal with a handwritten dated note 
it did eventually become his trademark as illustrated in anecdotes about this eccentricity such as the time he wore a white summer suit to a congressional hearing during the winter
mcmasters the mark twain encyclopedia states that twain did not wear a white suit in his last three years except at one banquet speech 
in his autobiography twain writes of his early experiments with wearing white out-of-season

next after fine colors i like plain white 
one of my sorrows when the summer ends is that i must put off my cheery and comfortable white clothes and enter for the winter into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones 
it is mid-october now and the weather is growing cold up here in the new hampshire hills but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments for here the neighbors are few and it is only of crowds that i am afraid 
i made a brave experiment the other night to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged 
on a stormy evening i made a talk before a full house in the village clothed like a ghost and looking as conspicuous all solitary and alone on that platform as any ghost could have looked and i found to my gratification that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings i had broughti am nearly seventy-one and i recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges valuable privileges privileges which are not granted to younger persons 
little by little i hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter in new york 
it will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer of my sex will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead 
light in august

light in august is a NUM novel by the southern american author william faulkner 
it belongs to the southern gothic and modernist literary genres 
set in the authors present day the interwar period the novel centers on two strangers who arrive at different times in jefferson yoknapatawpha county mississippi a fictional county based on faulkners home lafayette county mississippi 
the plot first focuses on lena grove a young pregnant white woman from alabama looking for the father of her unborn child and then shifts to explore the life of joe christmas a man who has settled in jefferson and passes as white but who secretly believes he has some black ancestry 
after a series of flashbacks narrating christmass early life the plot resumes with his living and working with lucas burch the father of lenas child who fled to jefferson and changed his name when he found out that lena was pregnant 
the woman on whose property christmas and burch have been living joanna burden a descendant of yankee abolitionists hated by the citizens of jefferson is murdered 
burch is caught at the scene of the crime and reveals that christmas had been romantically involved with her and is part black thus implying that he is guilty of her murder 
while burch sits in jail awaiting his reward for turning in christmas lena is assisted by byron bunch a shy mild-mannered bachelor who falls in love with her 
bunch seeks the aid of another outcast in the town the disgraced former minister gail hightower to help lena give birth and protect christmas from being lynched 
though hightower refuses the latter christmas escapes to his house and is shot and castrated by a state guardsman 
burch leaves town without his reward and the novel ends with an anonymous man recounting a story to his wife about some hitchhikers he picked up on the road to tennesseea woman with a child and a man who was not the father of the child both looking for the womans husband 
in a loose unstructured modernist narrative style that draws from christian allegory and oral storytelling faulkner explores themes of race sex class and religion in the american south 
by focusing on characters that are misfits outcasts or are otherwise marginalized in their community he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a puritanical prejudiced rural society 
early reception of the novel was mixed with some reviewers critical of faulkners style and subject matter 
however over time the novel has come to be considered one of the most important literary works by faulkner and one of the best english-language novels of the NUMth century 
the novel is set in the american south in the NUMs during the time of prohibition and jim crow laws that legalized racial segregation in the south 
it begins with the journey of lena grove a young pregnant white woman from doanes mill alabama who is trying to find lucas burch the father of her unborn child 
he has been fired from his job at doanes mill and moved to mississippi promising to send word to her when he has a new job 
not hearing from burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy lena walks and hitchhikes to jefferson mississippi a town in faulkners fictional yoknapatawpha county 
there she expects to find lucas working at another planing mill ready to marry her 
those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that lucas burch will be found or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him 
when she arrives in jefferson lucas is there but he has changed his name to joe brown 
looking for lucas sweet trusting lena meets shy mild-mannered byron bunch who falls in love with lena but feels honor-bound to help her find joe brown 
thoughtful and quietly religious byron is superior to brown in every way but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to lena 
the novel then switches to the second plot strand the story of lucas burchjoe browns partner joe christmas 
the surly psychopathic christmas has been on the run for years ever since presumably killing his strict methodist adopted father 
although he has light skin christmas suspects that he is of african american ancestry 
consumed with rage he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and white society constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike 
christmas comes to jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where byron and later joe brown works 
the job at the mill is a cover for christmass bootlegging operation which is illegal under prohibition 
he has a sexual relationship with joanna burden an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers 
though their relationship is passionate at first joanna begins menopause and turns to religion which frustrates and angers christmas 
at the end of her relationship with christmas joanna tries to force him at gunpoint to kneel and pray 
joanna is murdered soon after her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated 
the novel leaves readers uncertain whether joe christmas or joe brown is the murderer 
brown is christmas business partner in bootlegging and is leaving joannas burning house when a passing farmer stops to investigate and pull joannas body from the fire 
the sheriff at first suspects joe brown but initiates a manhunt for christmas after brown claims that christmas is black 
the manhunt is fruitless until christmas arrives undisguised in mottstown a neighboring town he is on his way back to jefferson no longer running 
in mottstown he is arrested and jailed then moved to jefferson 
his grandparents arrive in town and visit gail hightower the disgraced former minister of the town and friend of byron bunch 
bunch tries to convince hightower to give the imprisoned joe christmas an alibi but hightower initially refuses 
though his grandfather wants christmas lynched his grandmother visits him in the jefferson jail and advises him to seek help from hightower 
as police escort him to the local court christmas breaks free and runs to hightowers house 
a childishly cruel white vigilante percy grimm follows him there and over hightowers protest shoots and castrates christmas 
having redeemed himself at last hightower is then depicted as falling into a deathlike swoon his whole life flashing before his eyes including the past adventures of his confederate grandfather who was killed while stealing chickens from a farmers shed 
before christmas escape attempt hightower delivers lenas child in the cabin where brown and christmas had been staying before the murder and byron arranges for brownburch to come and see her 
brown deserts lena once again but byron follows him and challenges him to a fight 
brown beats the braver smaller bunch then skilfully hops a moving train and disappears 
at the end of the story an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to tennessee recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father 
this was lena and byron who were conducting a half-hearted search for brown and they are eventually dropped off in tennessee 
due to its naturalistic violent subject matter and obsession with the ghosts of the past light in august is characterized as a southern gothic novel a genre also exemplified by the works of faulkners contemporary carson mccullers and by later southern writers like flannery oconnor and truman capote 
however critics like diane roberts and david r jarraway view faulkners use of southern gothic genre tropes such as the dilapidated plantation house and the focus on mystery and horror as self-conscious modernist commentary on mans warped relationship with the past and the impossibility of determining true identity 
according to daniel joseph singal faulkners literary style gradually developed from NUMth century victorian to modernist with light in august more firmly grounded in the tradition of the latter 
the novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark good and evilthe burden of history on the present and the splintering of personal identity 
the plot is also divided into dual currents one focusing on lena grove and the other on joe christmas a technique that faulkner continued to use in other works 
the narrative is not structured in any particular order as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another 
this lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics 
as in his other novels faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct southern idiom 
unlike some of the other yoknapatawpha county novels notably the sound and the fury light in august does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story 
the title refers to the fire of the house that is at the center of the story 
the whole novel revolves around one event the fire which is visible for miles around and happens in august 
some critics have speculated that the meaning of the title derives from a colloquial use of the word light to mean giving birthtypically used to describe when a cow will give birth and be light againand connect this to lenas pregnancy 
speaking of his choice of title faulkner denied this interpretation and stated



.in august in mississippi theres a few days somewhere about the middle of the month when suddenly theres a foretaste of fall its cool theres a lambence a soft a luminous quality to the light as though it came not from just today but from back in the old classic times 
it might have fauns and satyrs and the gods andfrom greece from olympus in it somewhere 
it lasts just for a day or two then its gone 

.the title reminded me of that time of a luminosity older than our christian civilization 
within the novel itself the title is alluded to when gail hightower sits at his study window waiting for his recurring vision of his grandfathers last raid 
the vision always occurs in that instant when all light has failed out of the sky and it would be night save for that faint light which daygranaried leaf and grass blade reluctant suspire making still a little light on earth though night itself has come 
the story that would eventually become the novel started by faulkner in NUM was originally titled dark house and began with hightower sitting at a dark window in his home 
however after a casual remark by his wife estelle on the quality of the light in august faulkner changed the title 
all of the protagonists in the novel are misfits and social outcasts surrounded by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters 
joanna burden and reverend hightower are hounded by the people of jefferson for years in a failed effort to make them leave town 
byron bunch though more accepted in jefferson is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked 
both joe christmas and lena grove are orphans strangers in town and social outcasts though the former draws anger and violence from the community while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels 
according to cleanth brooks this opposition between joe and lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society 
there are a variety of parallels with christian scripture in the novel 
the life and death of joe christmas is reminiscent of the passion of christ lena and her fatherless child parallel mary and christ and byron bunch acts as a joseph figure 
christian imagery such as the urn the wheel and the shadow can be found throughout 
light in august has NUM chapters as does the gospel of st john 
as virginia v james hlavsa points out each chapter in faulkner corresponds to themes in john 
for example echoing johns famous in the beginning was the word and the word was with god is lenas insistent faith in the word of lucas who is after all the father 
john NUM the healing of the lame man by immersion is echoed by christmass repeatedly being immersed in liquids 
the teaching in the temple in john NUM is echoed by mceacherns attempts to teach christmas his catechism 
the crucifixion occurs in john NUM the same chapter in which christmas is slain and castrated 
however the christian references are dark and disturbinglena is obviously not a virgin christmas is an enraged murdererand may be more appropriately viewed as pagan idols mistakenly worshipped as saints 
faulkner is considered one of the foremost american writers on race in the united states and his novels including light in august often explore the persistent obsession with blood and race in the south that have carried over from the antebellum era to the NUMst century 
christmas has light skin but is viewed as a foreigner by the people he meets and the children in the orphanage in which he was raised call him nigger 
chapter NUM begins with the oft-cited sentence memory believes before knowing remembers and gives an account of the five year old christmas amongst the uniform denim of the other children 
the first reference to him though is not by these children but by the dietitian who gave him a dollar to not tell about her amorous adventure with an intern doctor 
however suspicion must fall on doc hines joes derranged grandfather who placed him in the orphanage and stays on as the boilerman 
it is he who may have whispered the lie about the liitle boys origines to the other children 
because of this joe christmas is fixated on the idea that he has some african american blood which faulkner never confirms and views his parentage as an original sin that has tainted his body and actions since birth 
because of his obsessive struggle with his twin identities black and white christmas lives his life always on the road 
the secret of his blackness is one that he abhors as well as cherishes he often willingly tells white people that he is black in order to see their extreme reactions and becomes violent when one white northern woman reacts nonchalantly 
though christmas is guilty of violent crimes faulkner emphasizes that he is under the sway of social and psychological forces that are beyond his control and force him to reenact the part of the mythical black murderer and rapist from southern history 
christmas exemplifies how existing outside of categorization being neither black nor white is perceived as a threat by society that can only be reconciled with violence 
he is also perceived as neither male nor female just as joanna burden whom faulkner portrays as masculinized is also neither male nor female and is rejected by her community 
because of this an early critic concluded that blackness and women were the twin furies of the faulknerian deep southern waste land and reflected faulkners animosity toward life 
however while women and minorities are both viewed as subversive and are restricted by the patriarchal society depicted in the novel lena grove is able to travel safely and be cared for by people who hate and mistrust her because she plays on the conventional rule that men are responsible for a womans wellbeing 
thus she is the only stranger who is not alienated and destroyed by the people of jefferson because the community recognizes her as the embodiment of nature and life 
this romantic view of women in the novel posits that men have lost their innocent connection to the natural world while women instinctively possess it 
in light in august as in most of the other novels set in yoknapatawpha county faulkner focuses mainly on poor white southerners both from the upper and lower classes who struggle to survive in the ruined post-war economy of the south 
the characters in light in augustwho are mostly from the lower classes with the exception of reverend hightower and joanna burdenare united by poverty and puritanical values that cause them to regard an unwed mother like lena grove with disdain 
faulkner shows the restrictiveness and aggression of their puritanical zeal which has caused them to become deformed in their struggle against nature 
when it was first published in NUM the novel was moderately successful NUM copies were initially printed with a total of four printings by the end of the year although a significant number of copies from the fourth printing had not been sold by NUM
in NUM maurice coindreau translated the novel into french 
in the same year it was translated into german along with several other novels and short stories by faulkner 
these works initially met with approval from the nazi censors and received much attention from german literary critics because they assumed that faulkner was a conservative agrarian positively depicting the struggle for racial purity soon after however faulkners works were banned by the nazis and post-war german criticism reappraised him as an optimistic christian humanist 
according to michael millgate though it is not typically considered faulkners best novel light in august was recognized early on as being a major text central to any understanding or evaluation of his career as a whole 
he argues that many of the early american critics most of whom were urban northerners who viewed the south as backward and reactionary focused on faulkners technical innovation in the field of narrative but missed or ignored the regional details and interconnectedness of the characters and setting to other works by the author 
some reviewers saw faulkners narrative techniques not as innovations but as errors offering faulkner recommendations on how to improve his style and admonishing him for his european modernist tricks
critics were also displeased with the violence depicted in the novel pejoratively labeling it gothic fantasy despite the fact that lynching was a reality in the south 
in spite of these complaints the novel came to be viewed positively because of its violence and dark themes as this was a contrast to the sentimental romantic southern literature of the time 
in NUM the modern library ranked light in august NUMth on its list of the NUM best english-language novels of the NUMth century 
additionally time magazine included the novel in its time NUM best english-language novels from NUM to NUM

literal and figurative language

literal and figurative language is a distinction within some fields of language analysis in particular stylistics rhetoric and semantics 
literal usage confers meaning to words in the sense of the meaning they have by themselves outside any figure of speech 
it maintains a consistent meaning regardless of the context with the intended meaning corresponding exactly to the meaning of the individual words 
figurative use of language is the use of words or phrases that implies a non-literal meaning which does make sense or that could also be true
aristotle and later the roman quintilian were among the early analysts of rhetoric who expounded on the differences between literal and figurative language 
in NUM frances brookes novel the history of emily montague was used in the earliest oxford english dictionary citation for the figurative sense of literally the sentence from the novel used was he is a fortunate man to be introduced to such a party of fine women at his arrival it is literally to feed among the lilies.
this citation was also used in the oeds NUM revision 
within literary analysis such terms are still used but within the fields of cognition and linguistics the basis for identifying such a distinction is no longer used 
figurative language can take multiple forms such as simile or metaphor 
merriam-websters encyclopedia of literature says that figurative language can be classified in five categories resemblance or relationship emphasis or understatement figures of sound verbal games and errors 
a simile is a comparison of two things indicated by some connective usually like as than or a verb such as resembles to show how they are similar 
a metaphor is a figure of speech in which two essentially unlike things are shown to have a type of resemblance or create a new image 
the similarities between the objects being compared may be implied rather than directly stated 
an extended metaphor is a metaphor that is continued over multiple sentences 
onomatopoeia is a word designed to be an imitation of a sound 
personification is the attribution of a personal nature or character to inanimate objects or abstract notions especially as a rhetorical figure 
an oxymoron is a figure of speech in which a pair of opposite or contradictory terms is used together for emphasis 
a paradox is a statement or proposition which is self-contradictory unreasonable or illogical 
hyperbole is a figure of speech which uses an extravagant or exaggerated statement to express strong feelings 
allusion is a reference to a famous character or event 
an idiom is an expression that has a figurative meaning unrelated to the literal meaning of the phrase 
a pun is an expression intended for a humorous or rhetorical effect by exploiting different meanings of words 
prior to the NUMs the standard pragmatic model of comprehension was widely believed 
in that model it was thought the recipient would first attempt to comprehend the meaning as if literal but when an appropriate literal inference could not be made the recipient would shift to look for a figurative interpretation that would allow comprehension 
since then research has cast doubt on the model 
in tests figurative language was found to be comprehended at the same speed as literal language and so the premise that the recipient was first attempting to process a literal meaning and discarding it before attempting to process a figurative meaning appears to be false 
beginning with the work of michael reddy in his NUM work the conduit metaphor many linguists now reject that there is a valid way to distinguish between a literal and figurative mode of language 
harriet beecher stowe

harriet elisabeth beecher stowe  june NUM NUM july NUM NUM was an american abolitionist and author 
she came from the beecher family a famous religious family and is best known for her novel uncle toms cabin NUM which depicts the harsh conditions for enslaved african americans

her mother was his first wife roxana foote a deeply religious woman who died when stowe was only five years old 
roxanas maternal grandfather was general andrew ward of the revolutionary war 
her notable siblings included a sister catharine beecher who became an educator and author as well as brothers who became ministers including henry ward beecher who became a famous preacher and abolitionist charles beecher and edward beecher 
harriet enrolled in the hartford female seminary run by her older sister catharine where she received a traditional academic education usually reserved for males at the time with a focus in the classics including studies of languages and mathematics 
among her classmates was sarah p willis who later wrote under the pseudonym fanny fern 
in NUM at the age of NUM harriet beecher moved to cincinnati ohio to join her father who had become the president of lane theological seminary 
there she also joined the semi-colon club a literary salon and social club whose members included the beecher sisters caroline lee hentz salmon p chase future governor of the state and secretary of treasury under president lincoln emily blackwell and others 
cincinnatis trade and shipping business on the ohio river was booming drawing numerous migrants from different parts of the country including many free blacks as well as irish immigrants who worked on the states canals and railroads 
areas of the city had been wrecked in the cincinnati riots of NUM when ethnic irish attacked blacks trying to push competitors out of the city 
beecher met a number of african americans who had suffered in those attacks and their experience contributed to her later writing about slavery 
riots took place again in NUM and NUM driven also by native-born anti-abolitionists 
it was in the literary club that she met calvin ellis stowe a widower who was a professor at the seminary 
the two married on january NUM NUM
he was an ardent critic of slavery and the stowes supported the underground railroad temporarily housing several fugitive slaves in their home 
most slaves continued north to secure freedom in canada 
the stowes had seven children together including twin daughters 
in NUM congress passed the fugitive slave law prohibiting assistance to fugitives and strengthening sanctions even in free states 
at the time stowe had moved with her family to brunswick maine where her husband was now teaching at bowdoin college 
their home near the campus is protected as a national historic resource in her honor 
stowe claimed to have a vision of a dying slave during a communion service at the college chapel which inspired her to write his story 
however what more likely allowed her to empathize with slaves was the loss of her eighteen-month-old son samuel charles stowe 
she even stated the following having experienced losing someone so close to me i can sympathize with all the poor powerless slaves at the unjust auctions 
you will always be in my heart samuel charles stowe 
on march NUM NUM stowe wrote to gamaliel bailey editor of the weekly anti-slavery journal the national era that she planned to write a story about the problem of slavery i feel now that the time is come when even a woman or a child who can speak a word for freedom and humanity is bound to speak .
i hope every woman who can write will not be silent 
shortly after in june NUM when she was NUM the first installment of her uncle toms cabin was published in serial form in the newspaper the national era

uncle toms cabin was published in book form on march NUM NUM by john p jewett with an initial print run of NUM copies 
each of its two volumes included three illustrations and a title-page designed by hammatt billings 
in less than a year the book sold an unprecedented NUM copies 
by december as sales began to wane jewett issued an inexpensive edition at NUM cents each to stimulate sales 
according to daniel r lincoln the goal of the book was to educate northerners on the realistic horrors of the things that were happening in the south 
the other purpose was to try to make people in the south feel more empathetic towards the people they were forcing into slavery 
the books emotional portrayal of the effects of slavery on individuals captured the nations attention 
stowe showed that slavery touched all of society beyond the people directly involved as masters traders and slaves 
her novel added to the debate about abolition and slavery and aroused opposition in the south 
in the south stowe was depicted as out of touch arrogant and guilty of slander 
within a year NUM babies in boston alone were named eva one of the books characters and a play based on the book opened in new york in november 
southerners quickly responded with numerous works of what are now called anti-tom novels seeking to portray southern society and slavery in more positive terms 
many of these were bestsellers although none matched the popularity of stowes work which set publishing records 
after the start of the civil war stowe traveled to the capital washington dc  where she met president abraham lincoln on november NUM NUM
stowes daughter hattie reported it was a very droll time that we had at the white house i assure you .
i will only say now that it was all very funnyand we were ready to explode with laughter all the while 
what lincoln said is a minor mystery 
her son later reported that lincoln greeted her by saying so you are the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war 
her own accounts are vague including the letter reporting the meeting to her husband i had a real funny interview with the president 
a year after the war stowe purchased property in florida 
in response to a newspaper article in NUM she wrote i came to florida the year after the war and held property in duval county ever since 
in all this time i have not received even an incivility from any native floridian 
stowe is controversial for her support of elizabeth campbell duchess of argyll whose father-in-law decades before was a leader in the highland clearances the transformation of the remote highlands of scotland from a militia-based society to an agricultural one that supported far fewer people 
the newly homeless moved to canada where very bitter accounts appeared 
it was stowes assignment to refute them using evidence the duchess provided in letter xvii volume NUM of her travel memoir sunny memories of foreign lands
stowe was vulnerable when she seemed to defend the cruelties in scotland as eagerly as she attacked the cruelties in the american south 
in NUM stowe became one of the first editors of hearth and home magazine one of several new publications appealing to women she departed after a year 
stowe campaigned for the expansion of married womens rights arguing in NUM that

in the NUMs stowes brother henry ward beecher was accused of adultery and became the subject of a national scandal 
unable to bear the public attacks on her brother stowe again fled to florida but asked family members to send her newspaper reports 
through the affair she remained loyal to her brother and believed he was innocent

various older stories by salinger contain characters similar to those in the catcher in the rye
while at columbia university salinger wrote a short story called the young folks in whit burnetts class one character from this story has been described as a thinly penciled prototype of sally hayes
in november NUM he sold the story slight rebellion off madison which featured holden caulfield to the new yorker but it wasnt published until december NUM NUM due to world war ii 
the story im crazy which was published in the december NUM NUM issue of colliers contained material that was later used in the catcher in the rye
in NUM the new yorker accepted a NUM-page manuscript about holden caulfield for publication but salinger later withdrew it 
the catcher in the rye is narrated in a subjective style from the point of view of holden caulfield following his exact thought processes 
there is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes for example as holden sits in a chair in his dorm minor events such as picking up a book or looking at a table unfold into discussions about experiences 
critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage colloquial speech of the time 
words and phrases that appear frequently include


bruce brooks held that holdens attitude remains unchanged at storys end implying no maturation thus differentiating the novel from young adult fiction 
in contrast louis menand thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending to teach adolescent readers that alienation is just a phase 
while brooks maintained that holden acts his age menand claimed that holden thinks as an adult given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives 
others highlight the dilemma of holdens state in between adolescence and adulthood 
holden is quick to become emotional 
i felt sorry as hell for .. is a phrase he often uses 
it is often said that holden changes at the end when he watches phoebe on the carousel and he talks about the golden ring and how its good for kids to try and grab it 
peter beidler in his a readers companion to j d salingers the catcher in the rye identifies the movie that the prostitute sunny refers to 
in chapter NUM she says that in the movie a boy falls off a boat 
the movie is captains courageous NUM starring spencer tracy 
sunny says that holden looks like the boy who fell off the boat 
beidler shows page NUM a still of the boy played by child-actor freddie bartholomew 
each caulfield child has literary talent 
db 
writes screenplays in hollywood holden also reveres db 
for his writing skill holdens own best subject but he also despises hollywood industry-based movies considering them the ultimate in phony as the writer has no space for his own imagination and describes db 
s move to hollywood to write for films as prostituting himself allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove and phoebe is a diarist 
this catcher in the rye is an analogy for holden who admires in children attributes that he struggles to find in adults like innocence kindness spontaneity and generosity 
falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes 
later phoebe and holden exchange roles as the catcher and the fallen he gives her his hunting hat the catchers symbol and becomes the fallen as phoebe becomes the catcher 
in their biography of salinger david shields and shane salerno argue that the catcher in the rye can best be understood as a disguised war novel 
salinger witnessed the horrors of world war ii but rather than writing a combat novel salinger according to shields and salerno took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel 
the catcher in the rye has been listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century 
shortly after its publication writing for the new york times nash k burger called it an unusually brilliant novel while james stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating holdens 
george h w bush called it a marvelous book listing it among the books that have inspired him 
in june NUM the bbcs finlo rohrer wrote that NUM years since publication the book is still regarded as the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager 
holden is at various times disaffected disgruntled alienated isolated directionless and sarcastic 
adam gopnik considers it one of the three perfect books in american literature along with adventures of huckleberry finn and the great gatsby and believes that no book has ever captured a city better than catcher in the rye captured new york in the fifties 
jeff pruchnic wrote an appraisal of the catcher in the rye after the death of jd 
salinger 
in this article pruchnic focuses on how the novel continues to be received incredibly well even after it has aged many generations 
pruchnic describes holden as a teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come 
bill gates said that the catcher in the rye is one of his favorite books ever 
however not all reception has been positive the book has had its share of critics 
rohrer writes many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in 
j d salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique 
that is to say he has done nothing 
rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book saying that it captures existential teenage angst and has a complex central character and accessible conversational style while at the same time some readers may dislike the use of NUMs new york vernacular and other things 
in NUM a teacher in tulsa oklahoma was fired for assigning the novel in class however he was later reinstated 
between NUM and NUM the catcher in the rye was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the united states 
the book was banned in the issaquah washington high schools in NUM as being part of an overall communist plot
in NUM it was both the most censored book and the second most taught book in public schools in the united states 
according to the american library association the catcher in the rye was the NUMth most frequently challenged book from NUM to NUM
it was one of the ten most challenged books of NUM and although it had been off the list for three years it reappeared in the list of most challenged books of NUM
the challenges generally begin with holdens frequent use of vulgar language with other reasons including sexual references blasphemy undermining of family values and moral codes encouragement of rebellion and promotion of drinking smoking lying promiscuity and sexual abuse 
often the challengers have been unfamiliar with the plot itself 
shelley keller-gage a high school teacher who faced objections after assigning the novel in her class noted that the challengers are being just like holden .
they are trying to be catchers in the rye
a streisand effect has been that this incident caused people to put themselves on the waiting list to borrow the novel when there was no waiting list before 
several shootings have been associated with salingers novel including robert john bardos murder of rebecca schaeffer and john hinckley jr s assassination attempt on ronald reagan 
additionally after fatally shooting john lennon mark david chapman was arrested with a copy of the book that he had purchased that same day inside of which he had written to holden caulfield from holden caulfield this is my statement
early in his career salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen 
in NUM a critically panned film version of his short story uncle wiggily in connecticut was released renamed my foolish heart the film took great liberties with salingers plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work 
the enduring popularity of the catcher in the rye however has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novels screen rights 
when the catcher in the rye was first released many offers were made to adapt it for the screen including one from samuel goldwyn producer of my foolish heart
in a letter written in the early NUMs salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of holden caulfield opposite margaret obrien and if he couldnt play the part himself to forget about it 
almost NUM years later the writer joyce maynard definitively concluded the only person who might ever have played holden caulfield would have been j d 
salinger 
salinger told maynard in the NUMs that jerry lewis tried for years to get his hands on the part of holden despite lewis not having read the novel until he was in his thirties 
celebrities ranging from marlon brando and jack nicholson to tobey maguire and leonardo dicaprio have since tried to make a film adaptation 
in an interview with premiere john cusack commented that his one regret about turning NUM was that he had become too old to play holden caulfield 
writer-director billy wilder recounted his abortive attempts to snare the novels rights

in NUM salinger denied elia kazan permission to direct a stage adaptation of catcher for broadway 
more recently salingers agents received bids for the catcher film rights from harvey weinstein and steven spielberg neither of which was even passed on to salinger for consideration 
in NUM the bbc television program the big read featured the catcher in the rye interspersing discussions of the novel with a series of short films that featured an actor playing j d salingers adolescent antihero holden caulfield 
the show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a literary review and no major charges were filed 
after salingers death in NUM phyllis westberg who was salingers agent at harold ober associates stated that nothing has changed in terms of licensing film television or stage rights of his works 
a letter written by salinger in NUM revealed that he was open to an adaptation of the catcher in the rye released after his death 
he wrote firstly it is possible that one day the rights will be sold 
since theres an ever-looming possibility that i wont die rich i toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy 
it pleasures me no end though i might quickly add to know that i wont have to see the results of the transaction 
salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment and that translating holden caulfields first-person narrative into voice-over and dialogue would be contrived 
in NUM a year before his death salinger successfully sued to stop the us publication of a novel that presents holden caulfield as an old man 
the novels author fredrik colting commented call me an ignorant swede but the last thing i thought possible in the us was that you banned books
the issue is complicated by the nature of coltings book NUM years later coming through the rye which has been compared to fan fiction 
although commonly not authorized by writers no legal action is usually taken against fan fiction since it is rarely published commercially and thus involves no profit 
colting however has published his book commercially therefore interfering with copyright law and is not protected 
the catcher in the rye has had significant cultural influence and works inspired by the novel have been said to form their own genre 
sarah graham assessed works influenced by the catcher in the rye to include the novels less than zero by bret easton ellis the perks of being a wallflower by stephen chbosky a complicated kindness by miriam toews the bell jar by sylvia plath ordinary people by judith guest and the film igby goes down by burr steers 
fantasy writer harry turtledove has written a pastiche-parody catcher in the rhine based on his daughters mishearing of salingers title 
in this short story an unnamed narrator who is clearly meant to be holden caulfield but is unnamed to avoid copyright problems goes on vacation to germany and meets characters from the niebelunglied
this was first published in the chick is in the mail edited by esther friesner baen NUM and reprinted in the omnibus chicks ahoy
NUM
it was reprinted in atlantis and other places also in NUM
in catcher in the wry former major league baseball player bob uecker recounts anecdotes of his years behind the plate and on the road recalling the antics of his famous teammates including hank aaron bob gibson richie allen and warren spahn 
the july NUM issue of national lampoon included a parody of the novel ostensibly written by holden caulfields son entitled the son of the catcher who lives in rye
in december NUM punk rock band green day released their second studio album kerplunk containing the song who wrote holden caulfield 
the song describes said character as crazy frustrated and lacking motivation

william gaddis

william thomas gaddis jr december NUM NUM december NUM NUM was an american novelist 
the first and longest of his five novels the recognitions was named one of time magazines NUM best novels from NUM to NUM
and two others j r and a frolic of his own won the annual us national book award for fiction 
a collection of his essays was published posthumously as the rush for second place NUM
the letters of william gaddis was published by dalkey archive press in february NUM
gaddis is widely considered one of the first and most important american postmodern writers 
gaddis was born in new york city to william thomas gaddis who worked on wall street and in politics and edith charles gaddis an executive for the new york steam corporation 
when he was NUM his parents separated and gaddis was subsequently raised by his mother in massapequa long island 
at age NUM he was sent to merricourt boarding school in berlin connecticut 
he continued in private school until the eighth grade after which he returned to long island to receive his diploma at farmingdale high school in NUM
he entered harvard in NUM where he was a member of the harvard lampoon where he eventually served as president but was asked to leave in NUM due to an altercation with police 
he worked as a fact checker for the new yorker for little over a year late february NUM until late april NUM then spent five years traveling in mexico central america spain france england and north africa returning to the united states in NUM
his first novel the recognitions appeared in NUM
a lengthy complex and allusive work it had to wait to find its audience 
newspaper reviewers considered it overly intellectual overwritten and perhaps on the principle of  all that is unknown appears obscene filthy 
the book was defended by jack green in a series of broadsheets blasting the critics the series was collected later under the title fire the bastards
shortly after the publication of the recognitions gaddis married his first wife patricia black who would give birth to two children sarah who has written a novel swallow hard inspired by her relationship with her father and matthew 
gaddis then turned to public relations work and the making of documentary films to support himself and his family 
in this role he worked for pfizer eastman kodak ibm and the united states army among others 
he also received a national institute of arts and letters grant a rockefeller grant and two national endowment for the arts grants all of which helped him write his second novel 
in NUM he published j r
told almost entirely in unattributed dialogue 
its eponymous protagonist an NUM-year-old learns enough about the stock market from a class field trip to build a financial empire of his own 
critical opinion had caught up with him and the book won the national book award for fiction 
his marriage to his second wife judith thompson dissolved shortly after j r was published 
by the late NUMs gaddis had entered into a relationship with muriel oxenberg murphy and they lived together until the mid-NUMs 
carpenters gothic NUM offered a shorter and more accessible picture of gaddiss sardonic worldview 
instead of struggling against misanthropy as in the recognitions or reluctantly giving ground to it as in j r carpenters gothic wallows in it 
the continual litigation that was a theme in that book becomes the central theme and plot device in a frolic of his own NUMwhich earned him his second national book award and was a finalist for the national book critics circle award for fictionwhere it seems that everyone is suing someone 
there are even two japanese cars called the isuyu and the sosumi 
gaddis died at home in east hampton new york of prostate cancer on december NUM NUM but not before creating his final work agap agape the first word of the title is the greek agap meaning divine unconditional love which was published in NUM a novella in the form of the last words of a character similar but not identical to his creator 
the rush for second place published at the same time collected most of gaddiss previously published nonfiction 
among fans of post-modern fiction gaddis is often acknowledged as being one of the greatest of american post-war novelists 
a critic who early on appreciated his work and recognized its value is steven moore in NUM he published a readers guide to william gaddiss the recognitions and in NUM a monograph on gaddis in the twayne series 
gaddiss influence is vast although frequently subterranean for example postmodern authors such as don delillo and thomas pynchon seem to have been influenced by gaddis indeed upon publication of v  pynchon was actually speculated to have been a pen name for gaddis due to the similarity of styles and the dearth of information about the two authors the wanda tinasky letters also claimed that gaddis pynchon and jack green were the same person as well as authors such as joseph mcelroy william gass david markson and david foster wallace who have all stated their admiration for gaddis in general and the recognitions in particular 
jonathan franzen who in an essay in the new yorker called gaddis an old literary hero of mine dubbed him mr 
difficult stating that by a comfortable margin the most difficult book i ever voluntarily read in its entirety was gaddis nine-hundred-and-fifty-six-page first novel the recognitions.
franzen continued in the four decades following the publication of the recognitions gaddiss work grew angrier and angrier 
its a signature paradox of literary postmodernism the writer whose least angry work was written first 
characters in fiction based on gaddis include harry lees in chandler brossards NUM novel who walk in darkness harold sand in jack kerouacs autobiographical NUM novella the subterraneans and possibly bill gray in don delillos NUM novel mao ii
delillo was a friend of gaddis 
the characters richard whitehurst in kurt wenzels lit life a novel NUM and joshua gel in stephen dixons i a novel NUM likely are based on gaddis 
authors clearly influenced by gaddis include jonathan franzen the corrections david markson epitaph for a tramp joseph mcelroy a smugglers bible and stanley elkin the magic kingdom
his life and work are the subject of a comprehensive website the gaddis annotations which has been noted in at least one academic journal as a superior example of scholarship using new media resources 
gaddiss papers are collected at washington university in st louis 
the first book-length biography joseph tabbis nobody grew but the business on the life and work of william gaddis was published by northwestern university press in may NUM
beside the awards for particular works gaddis has received three other awards and honors
harper lee

nelle harper lee april NUM NUMfebruary NUM NUM better known by her pen name harper lee was an american novelist widely known for to kill a mockingbird published in NUM
immediately successful it won the NUM pulitzer prize and has become a classic of modern american literature 
though lee had only published this single book in NUM she was awarded the presidential medal of freedom for her contribution to literature 
additionally lee received numerous honorary degrees though she declined to speak on those occasions 
she was also known for assisting her close friend truman capote in his research for the book in cold blood NUM
capote was the basis for the character dill in to kill a mockingbird
the plot and characters of to kill a mockingbird are loosely based on lees observations of her family and neighbors as well as an event that occurred near her hometown in NUM when she was NUMyears old 
the novel deals with the irrationality of adult attitudes towards race and class in the deep south of the NUMs as depicted through the eyes of two children 
the novel was inspired by racist attitudes in her hometown of monroeville alabama 
another novel go set a watchman was written in the mid-NUMs and published in july NUM as a sequel though it was later confirmed to be to kill a mockingbirds first draft 
nelle harper lee was born on april NUM NUM in monroeville alabama where she grew up as the youngest of four children of frances cunningham finch and amasa coleman lee 
her parents chose her middle name harper to honor pediatrician dr william w harper of selma alabama who saved the life of her sister louise 
her first name nelle was her grandmothers name spelled backwards and the name she used harper lee being primarily her pen name 
lees mother was a homemaker her father a former newspaper editor and proprietor practiced law and served in the alabama state legislature from NUM to NUM
before ac lee became a title lawyer he once defended two black men accused of murdering a white storekeeper 
both clients a father and son were hanged 
lee had three siblings alice finch lee NUM louise lee conner NUM and edwin lee NUM
while enrolled at monroe county high school lee developed an interest in english literature 
after graduating from high school in NUM she attended the then all-female huntingdon college in montgomery for a year then transferred to the university of alabama in tuscaloosa where she studied law for several years and wrote for the university newspaper but did not complete a degree 
in the summer of NUM lee attended a summer school in european civilization at oxford university in england financed by her father who hoped  in vain as it turned out  that the experience would make her more interested in her legal studies in tuscaloosa 
in NUM lee moved to new york city and took a job as an airline reservation agent writing fiction in her spare time 
having written several long stories lee found an agent in november NUM
the following month at michael browns east NUMth street townhouse she received a gift of a years wages from friends with a note you have one year off from your job to write whatever you please 
merry christmas 
in the spring of NUM a NUM-year-old lee delivered the manuscript for go set a watchman to her agent to send out to publishers including the now-defunct j 
b lippincott company which eventually bought it 
at lippincott the novel fell into the hands of therese von hohoff torreyknown professionally as tay hohoff 
hohoff was impressed 
the spark of the true writer flashed in every line she would later recount in a corporate history of lippincott 
but as hohoff saw it the manuscript was by no means fit for publication 
it was as she described it more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel
during the next couple of years she led lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled to kill a mockingbird
like many unpublished authors lee was unsure of her talents 
i was a first-time writer so i did as i was told lee said in a statement in NUM about the evolution from watchman to mockingbird
hohoff offers a more detailed characterization of the process in the lippincott corporate history after a couple of false starts the story-line interplay of characters and fall of emphasis grew clearer and with each revisionthere were many minor changes as the story grew in strength and in her own vision of itthe true stature of the novel became evident 
in NUM lippincott was acquired by harper  row which became harpercollins publisher of watchman 
there appeared to be a natural give and take between author and editor 
when she disagreed with a suggestion we talked it out sometimes for hours hohoff wrote 
and sometimes she came around to my way of thinking sometimes i to hers sometimes the discussion would open up an entirely new line of country 
as for her relationship with lee its clear that hohoff provided more than just editorial guidance 
one winter night as charles j shields recounts in mockingbird a portrait of harper lee lee threw her manuscript out her window and into the snow before calling hohoff in tears 
tay told her to march outside immediately and pick up the pages shields wrote 
when the novel was finally ready the author opted to use the name harper lee rather than risk having her first name nelle be misidentified as nellie
published july NUM NUM to kill a mockingbird was an immediate bestseller and won great critical acclaim including the pulitzer prize for fiction in NUM
it remains a bestseller with more than NUM million copies in print 
in NUM it was voted best novel of the century in a poll by the library journal
like lee the tomboy scout of the novel is the daughter of a respected small-town alabama attorney 
scouts friend dill was inspired by lees childhood friend and neighbor truman capote lee in turn is the model for a character in capotes first novel other voices other rooms published in NUM
although the plot of lees novel involves an unsuccessful legal defense similar to one undertaken by her attorney father the NUM landmark scottsboro boys interracial rape case may also have helped to shape lees social conscience 
while lee herself downplayed autobiographical parallels in the book truman capote mentioning the character boo radley in to kill a mockingbird described details he considered autobiographical in my original version of other voices other rooms i had that same man living in the house that used to leave things in the trees and then i took that out 
he was a real man and he lived just down the road from us 
we used to go and get those things out of the trees 
everything she wrote about it is absolutely true 
but you see i take the same thing and transfer it into some gothic dream done in an entirely different way 
after completing to kill a mockingbird lee accompanied capote to holcomb kansas to assist him in researching what they thought would be an article on a small towns response to the murder of a farmer and his family 
capote expanded the material into his best-selling book in cold blood published in NUM
from the time of the publication of to kill a mockingbird until her death in NUM lee granted almost no requests for interviews or public appearances and with the exception of a few short essays published nothing further until NUM
she did work on a follow-up novelthe long goodbyebut eventually filed it away unfinished 
during the mid-NUMs she began a factual book about an alabama serial murderer but also put it aside when she was not satisfied 
her withdrawal from public life prompted unfounded speculation that new publications were in the works 
lee said of the NUM academy awardwinning screenplay adaptation of to kill a mockingbird by horton foote i think it is one of the best translations of a book to film ever made 
she became a friend of gregory peck and after his death remained close to the actors family pecks grandson harper peck voll is named after her 
peck won an oscar for his portrayal of atticus finch the father of the novels narrator scout 
in january NUM president lyndon b johnson appointed lee to the national council on the arts 
in NUM lee wrote a letter to the editor in response to the attempts of a richmond virginia area school board to ban to kill a mockingbird as immoral literature

james j kilpatrick the editor of the richmond news leader started the beadle bumble fund to pay fines for victims of what he termed despots on the bench
he built the fund using contributions from readers and later used it to defend books as well as people 
after the board in richmond ordered schools to dispose of all copies of to kill a mockingbird kilpatrick wrote a more moral novel scarcely could be imagined 
in the name of the beadle bumble fund he then offered free copies to children who wrote in and by the end of the first week he had given away NUM copies 
when lee attended the NUM alabama history and heritage festival in eufaula alabama she presented the essay romance and high adventure
late in NUM lee spent some time in alexander city alabama researching a true-crime book called the reverend
lee lived for NUM years at NUM east NUMnd street in manhattan 
in march NUM lee arrived in philadelphia her first trip to the city since signing with publisher lippincott in NUM to receive the inaugural atty award for positive depictions of attorneys in the arts from the spector gadon  rosen foundation 
at the urging of pecks widow veronique peck lee traveled by train from monroeville to los angeles in NUM to accept the los angeles public library literary award 
she also attended luncheons for students who have written essays based on her work held annually at the university of alabama 
on may NUM NUM she accepted an honorary degree from the university of notre dame where graduating seniors saluted her with copies of to kill a mockingbird during the ceremony

while attending an august NUM NUM ceremony inducting four members into the alabama academy of honor lee declined an invitation to address the audience saying well its better to be silent than to be a fool 
on november NUM NUM george w bush presented lee with the presidential medal of freedom 
this is the highest civilian award in the united states and recognizes individuals who have made an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the united states world peace cultural or other significant public or private endeavors
in NUM president barack obama awarded lee the national medal of arts the highest award given by the united states government for outstanding contributions to the excellence growth support and availability of the arts
in a NUM interview with an australian newspaper rev 
dr thomas lane butts said lee now lived in an assisted-living facility wheelchair-bound partially blind and deaf and suffering from memory loss 
butts also shared that lee told him why she never wrote again two reasons one i wouldnt go through the pressure and publicity i went through with to kill a mockingbird for any amount of money 
second i have said what i wanted to say and i will not say it again 
on may NUM NUM lee had filed a lawsuit in the united states district court to regain the copyright to to kill a mockingbird seeking unspecified damages from a son-in-law of her former literary agent and related entities 
lee claimed that the man engaged in a scheme to dupe her into assigning him the copyright on the book in NUM when her hearing and eyesight were in decline and she was residing in an assisted-living facility after having suffered a stroke 
in september NUM attorneys for both sides announced a settlement of the lawsuit 
in february NUM lee settled a lawsuit against the monroe county heritage museum for an undisclosed amount 
the suit alleged that the museum had used her name and the title to kill a mockingbird to promote itself and to sell souvenirs without her consent 
lees attorneys had filed a trademark application on august NUM NUM to which the museum filed an opposition 
this prompted lees attorney to file a lawsuit on october NUM that same year which takes issue the museums website and gift shop which it accuses of palming off its goods including t-shirts coffee mugs other various trinkets with mockingbird brands 
according to lees lawyer tonja carter following an initial meeting to appraise lees assets in NUM she re-examined lees safe-deposit box in NUM and found the manuscript for go set a watchman
after contacting lee and reading the manuscript she passed it on to lees agent andrew nurnberg 
on february NUM NUM it was announced that harpercollins would publish go set a watchman which includes versions of many of the characters in to kill a mockingbird
according to a harpercollins press release it was originally thought that the watchman manuscript was lost 
according to nurnberg mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy they discussed publishing mockingbird first watchman last and a shorter connecting novel between the two 
jonathan mahlers account in the new york times of how watchman was only ever really considered to be the first draft of mockingbird makes this assertion seem unlikely 
evidence where the same passages exist in both books in many cases word for word also further refutes this assertion 
the book was controversially published in july NUM as a sequel to to kill a mockingbird though it has been confirmed to be the first draft of the latter with many narrative incongruities repackaged and released as a completely separate work 
the book is set some NUM years after the time period depicted in mockingbird when scout returns as an adult from new york to visit her father in maycomb alabama 
it alludes to scouts view of her father atticus finch as the moral compass watchman of maycomb and according to the publisher how she finds upon her return to maycomb that she is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her fathers attitude toward society and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood 
not all reviewers have such a harsh opinion about the publication of the sequel book 
michiko kakutani in books of the times article finds that the book makes for disturbing reading when scout is shocked to find .. that her beloved father .. has been affiliating with raving anti-integration anti-black crazies and the reader shares her horror and confusion .
though it lacks the lyricism .. the portions of watchman dealing with scouts childhood and her adult romance with henry capture the daily rhythms of life in a small town and are peppered with portraits of minor characters and she mentions that students of writing will find watchman fascinating 
while not fully praising the book she finds the publication of watchman an important step stone in understanding harper lees work 
the publication of the novel announced by her lawyer raised concerns over why lee who for NUM years had maintained that she would never write another book would suddenly choose to publish again 
in february NUM the state of alabama through its human resources department launched an investigation into whether lee was competent enough to consent to the publishing of go set a watchman
the investigation found that the claims of coercion and elder abuse were unfounded and according to lees lawyer lee was happy as hell with the publication 
this characterization however was contested by many of lees friends 
marja mills author of the mockingbird next door life with harper lee a friend and former neighbor painted a very different picture 
in her piece for the washington post the harper lee i knew she quoted alicelees sister whom she described as gatekeeper advisor protector for most of lees adult lifeas saying poor nelle harper cant see and cant hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence 
she made note that watchman was announced just two and a half months after alices death and that all correspondence to and from lee went through her new attorney 
she described lee as in a wheelchair in an assisted living center nearly deaf and blind with a uniformed guard posted at the door and her visitors restricted to those on an approved list 
new york times columnist joe nocera continued this argument 
he also took issue with how the book was promoted by the murdoch empire as a newly discovered novel attesting that the other people in the sothebys meeting insisted that lees attorney was present in NUM when lees former agent who was subsequently fired and the sothebys specialist found the manuscript 
they said she knew full well that it was the same one submitted to tay hohoff in the NUMs that was reworked into mockingbird and that lees lawyer tonja carter had been sitting on the discovery waiting for the moment when she and not alice would be in charge of harper lees affairs 
stephen peck son of actor gregory peck also expressed concern 
responding to the question of how he thought his father would have reacted to the book he said that he would have appreciated the discussion the book has prompted but would have been troubled by the decision to publish it 
peck noted that his father considered lee a dear friend 
she gave him the pocket watch that had belonged to her father on whom she modeled atticus and that gregory wore it the night he won an oscar for the role 
stephen who is president and chief executive of the united states veterans initiative went on to say i think he would have felt very protective of her and that his father would have counseled lee not to publish watchman because it could taint mockingbird one of the most beloved novels in american history 
not to protect himself but to protect her peck said also noting that the decision to publish it was made not long after the death of alice lee who had long handled harper lees affairs 
you just dont know how that decision was made 
..
if he had to he would have flown down to talk to her 
i have no doubt 
later in the article which was posted in the wall street journal he said to me it was an unedited draft 
do you want to put that early version out there or do you want to put it in the university of alabama archives for scholars to look at
lee died in her sleep on the morning of february NUM NUM aged NUM
prior to her death she lived in monroeville alabama 
on february NUM her funeral was held at first united methodist church in monroeville 
the service was attended by close family and friends and the eulogy was given by wayne flynt 
after her death the new york times filed a lawsuit that argued that since lees will was filed in a probate court in alabama that it should be part of the public record 
they argued that wills filed in a probate court are considered part of the public record and that lees should follow suit 
harper lee was portrayed by catherine keener in the film capote NUM by sandra bullock in the film infamous NUM and by tracey hoyt in the tv movie scandalous me the jacqueline susann story NUM
in the adaptation of truman capotes novel other voices other rooms NUM the character of idabel thompkins who was inspired by capotes memories of lee as a child was played by aubrey dollar 
american literature

american literature is literature written or produced in the united states and its preceding colonies for specific discussions of poetry and theater see poetry of the united states and theater in the united states
before the founding of the united states the british colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day united states were heavily influenced by english literature 
the american literary tradition thus began as part of the broader tradition of english literature 
the revolutionary period is notable for the political writings of benjamin franklin and thomas paine 
thomas jeffersons united states declaration of independence solidified his status as a key american writer 
it was in the late NUMth and early NUMth centuries that the nations first novels were published 
an early example is william hill browns the power of sympathy published in NUM
browns novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fall in love without knowing they are related 
with an increasing desire to produce uniquely american literature and culture a number of key new literary figures emerged perhaps most prominently washington irving and edgar allan poe 
in NUM ralph waldo emerson started an influential movement known as transcendentalism 
inspired by that movement henry david thoreau wrote walden which celebrates individualism and nature and urges resistance to the dictates of organized society 
the political conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired the writings of william lloyd garrison and harriet beecher stowe in her famous novel uncle toms cabin
these efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narratives such as frederick douglasss narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave 
in the mid-nineteenth century nathaniel hawthorne published his masterpiece the scarlet letter a novel about adultery 
hawthorne influenced herman melville who is notable for the books moby-dick and billy budd
americas greatest poets of the nineteenth century were walt whitman and emily dickinson 
mark twain the pen name used by samuel langhorne clemens was the first major american writer to be born away from the east coast 
henry james put american literature on the international map with novels like the portrait of a lady
at the turn of the twentieth century a strong naturalist movement emerged that comprised writers such as edith wharton stephen crane theodore dreiser and jack london 
american writers expressed disillusionment following ww i 
the stories and novels of f scott fitzgerald capture the mood of the NUMs and john dos passos wrote too about the war 
ernest hemingway became famous with the sun also rises and a farewell to arms in NUM he won the nobel prize in literature 
william faulkner became one of the greatest american writers with novels like the sound and the fury
american poetry reached a peak after world war i with such writers as wallace stevens t s eliot robert frost ezra pound and e e cummings 
american drama attained international status at the time with the works of eugene oneill who won four pulitzer prizes and the nobel prize 
in the mid-twentieth century american drama was dominated by the work of playwrights tennessee williams and arthur miller as well as by the maturation of the american musical 
depression era writers included john steinbeck notable for his novel the grapes of wrath
henry miller assumed a distinct place in american literature in the NUMs when his semi-autobiographical novels were banned from the us 
from the end of world war ii until the early NUMs many popular works in modern american literature were produced like harper lees to kill a mockingbird
americas involvement in world war ii influenced works such as norman mailers the naked and the dead NUM joseph hellers catch-NUM NUM and kurt vonnegut jr s slaughterhouse-five NUM
the main literary movement since the NUMs has been postmodernism and since the late twentieth century ethnic and minority literature has sharply increased 
because of the large immigration to boston in the NUMs the articulation of puritan ideals and the early establishment of a college and a printing press in cambridge the new england colonies have often been regarded as the center of early american literature 
however the first european settlements in north america had been founded elsewhere many years earlier 
towns older than boston include the spanish settlements at saint augustine and santa fe the dutch settlements at albany and new amsterdam as well as the english colony of jamestown in present-day virginia 
during the colonial period the printing press was active in many areas from cambridge and boston to new york philadelphia and annapolis 
the dominance of the english language was not inevitable 
the first item printed in pennsylvania was in german and was the largest book printed in any of the colonies before the american revolution 
spanish and french had two of the strongest colonial literary traditions in the areas that now comprise the united states and discussions of early american literature commonly include texts by lvar nez cabeza de vaca and samuel de champlain alongside english language texts by thomas harriot and john smith 
moreover we are now aware of the wealth of oral literary traditions already existing on the continent among the numerous different native american groups 
political events however would eventually make english the lingua franca for the colonies at large as well as the literary language of choice 
for instance when the english conquered new amsterdam in NUM they renamed it new york and changed the administrative language from dutch to english 
from NUM to NUM only about NUM separate items were issued from the major printing presses in the american colonies 
this is a small number compared to the output of the printers in london at the time 
london printers published materials written by new england authors so the body of american literature was larger than what was published in north america 
however printing was established in the american colonies before it was allowed in most of england 
in england restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations where the government could monitor what was published london york oxford and cambridge 
because of this the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial english counterparts 
back then some of the american literature were pamphlets and writings extolling the benefits of the colonies to both a european and colonist audience 
captain john smith could be considered the first american author with his works a true relation of such occurrences and accidents of noate as hath happened in virginia .. NUM and the generall historie of virginia new england and the summer isles NUM
other writers of this manner included daniel denton thomas ash william penn george percy william strachey daniel coxe gabriel thomas and john lawson 
the religious disputes that prompted settlement in america were important topics of early american literature 
a journal written by john winthrop the history of new england discussed the religious foundations of the massachusetts bay colony 
edward winslow also recorded a diary of the first years after the mayflowers arrival 
a modell of christian charity by john winthrop the first governor of massachusetts was a sermon preached on the arbella the flagship of the winthrop fleet in NUM
this work outlined the ideal society that he and the other separatists would build in an attempt to realize a puritan utopia
other religious writers included increase mather and william bradford author of the journal published as a history of plymouth plantation NUM
others like roger williams and nathaniel ward more fiercely argued state and church separation 
and still others like thomas morton cared little for the church mortons the new english canaan mocked the religious settlers and declared that the native americans were actually better people than the british 
puritan poetry was highly religious and one of the earliest books of poetry published was the bay psalm book a set of translations of the biblical psalms however the translators intention was not to create literature but to create hymns that could be used in worship 
among lyric poets the most important figures are anne bradstreet who wrote personal poems about her family and homelife pastor edward taylor whose best poems the preparatory meditations were written to help him prepare for leading worship and michael wigglesworth whose best-selling poem the day of doom NUM describes the time of judgment 
it was published in the same year that anti-puritan charles ii was restored to the british throne 
he followed it two years later with gods controversy with new england
nicholas noyes was also known for his doggerel verse 
other late writings described conflicts and interaction with the indians as seen in writings by daniel gookin alexander whitaker john mason benjamin church and mary rowlandson 
john eliot translated the bible into the algonquin language 
of the second generation of new england settlers cotton mather stands out as a theologian and historian who wrote the history of the colonies with a view to gods activity in their midst and to connecting the puritan leaders with the great heroes of the christian faith 
his best-known works include the magnalia christi americana the wonders of the invisible world and the biblia americana
jonathan edwards and george whitefield represented the great awakening a religious revival in the early NUMth century that emphasized calvinism 
other puritan and religious writers include thomas hooker thomas shepard john wise and samuel willard 
less strict and serious writers included samuel sewall who wrote a diary revealing the daily life of the late NUMth century and sarah kemble knight 
new england was not the only area in the colonies with a literature southern literature was also growing at this time 
the diary of william byrd and the history of the dividing line described the expedition to survey the swamp between virginia and north carolina but also comments on the differences between american indians and the white settlers in the area 
in a similar book travels through north and south carolina georgia east and west william bartram described the southern landscape and the indian tribes he encountered bartrams book was popular in europe being translated into german french and dutch 
as the colonies moved toward independence from britain an important discussion of american culture and identity came from the french immigrant j hector st john de crvecur whose letters from an american farmer addresses the question what is an american
by moving between praise for the opportunities and peace offered in the new society and recognition that the solid life of the farmer must rest uneasily between the oppressive aspects of the urban life and the lawless aspects of the frontier where the lack of social structures leads to the loss of civilized living 
this same period saw the beginning of black literature through the poet phillis wheatley and the slave narrative of olaudah equiano the interesting narrative of the life of olaudah equiano
at this time american indian literature also began to flourish 
samson occom published his a sermon preached at the execution of moses paul and a popular hymnbook collection of hymns and spiritual songs the first indian best-seller
the revolutionary period also contained political writings including those by colonists samuel adams josiah quincy john dickinson and joseph galloway the last being a loyalist to the crown 
two key figures were benjamin franklin and thomas paine 
franklins poor richards almanac and the autobiography of benjamin franklin are esteemed works with their wit and influence toward the formation of a budding american identity 
paines pamphlet common sense and the american crisis writings are seen as playing a key role in influencing the political tone of the time 
during the revolutionary war poems and songs such as yankee doodle and nathan hale were popular 
major satirists included john trumbull and francis hopkinson 
philip morin freneau also wrote poems about the war 
during the NUMth century writing shifted from the puritanism of winthrop and bradford to enlightenment ideas of reason 
the belief that human and natural occurrences were messages from god no longer fit with the new human-centered world 
many intellectuals believed that the human mind could comprehend the universe through the laws of physics as described by isaac newton 
one of these was cotton mather 
the first book published in north america that promoted newton and natural theology was mathers the christian philosopher NUM
the enormous scientific economic social and philosophical changes of the NUMth century called the enlightenment impacted the authority of clergyman and scripture making way for democratic principles 
the increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life as seen in the literature of this time 
in NUM the population of the colonies numbered approximately NUM
thirty years later it was more than NUM
by NUM it reached NUM
the growth of communities and therefore social life led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience in the colonies 
these new ideas can be seen in the popularity of benjamin franklins autobiography
even earlier than franklin was cadwallader colden NUM - NUM whose book the history of the five indian nations published in NUM was one of the first texts critical of the treatment of the iroquois in upstate new york by the english 
colden also wrote a book on botany which attracted the attention of linnaeus and he maintained a long term correspondence with benjamin franklin 
in the post-war period thomas jefferson established his place in american literature through his authorship of the united states declaration of independence his influence on the united states constitution his autobiography his notes on the state of virginia and his many letters 
the federalist essays by alexander hamilton james madison and john jay presented a significant historical discussion of american government organization and republican values 
fisher ames james otis and patrick henry are also valued for their political writings and orations 
early american literature struggled to find a unique voice in existing literary genre and this tendency was reflected in novels 
european styles were frequently imitated but critics usually considered the imitations inferior 
in the late NUMth and early NUMth centuries the first american novels were published 
these fictions were too lengthy to be printed as manuscript or public reading 
publishers took a chance on these works in hopes they would become steady sellers and need to be reprinted 
this scheme was ultimately successful because male and female literacy rates were increasing at the time 
among the first american novels are thomas attwood digges adventures of alonso published in london in NUM and william hill browns the power of sympathy published in NUM
browns novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fell in love without knowing they were related 
in the next decade important women writers also published novels 
susanna rowson is best known for her novel charlotte a tale of truth published in london in NUM
in NUM the novel was reissued in philadelphia under the title charlotte temple 
charlotte temple is a seduction tale written in the third person which warns against listening to the voice of love and counsels resistance 
she also wrote nine novels six theatrical works two collections of poetry six textbooks and countless songs 
reaching more than a million and a half readers over a century and a half charlotte temple was the biggest seller of the NUMth century before stowes uncle toms cabin 
although rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early american novel charlotte temple is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction 
hannah webster fosters the coquette or the history of eliza wharton was published in NUM and was also extremely popular 
told from fosters point of view and based on the real life of eliza whitman the novel is about a woman who is seduced and abandoned 
eliza is a coquette who is courted by two very different men a clergyman who offers her a comfortable domestic life and a noted libertine 
unable to choose between them she finds herself single when both men get married 
she eventually yields to the artful libertine and gives birth to an illegitimate stillborn child at an inn 
the coquette is praised for its demonstration of the eras contradictory ideas of womanhood 
even as it has been criticized for delegitimizing protest against womens subordination 
both the coquette and charlotte temple are novels that treat the right of women to live as equals as the new democratic experiment 
these novels are of the sentimental genre characterized by overindulgence in emotion an invitation to listen to the voice of reason against misleading passions as well as an optimistic overemphasis on the essential goodness of humanity 
sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature 
while many of these novels were popular the economic infrastructure of the time did not allow these writers to make a living through their writing alone 
charles brockden brown is the earliest american novelist whose works are still commonly read 
he published wieland in NUM and in NUM published ormond edgar huntly and arthur mervyn
these novels are of the gothic genre 
the first writer to be able to support himself through the income generated by his publications alone was washington irving 
he completed his first major book in NUM entitled a history of new-york from the beginning of the world to the end of the dutch dynasty 
of the picaresque genre hugh henry brackenridge published modern chivalry in NUM-NUM tabitha gilman tenney wrote female quixotism exhibited in the romantic opinions and extravagant adventure of dorcasina sheldon in NUM royall tyler wrote the algerine captive in NUM
other notable authors include william gilmore simms who wrote martin faber in NUM guy rivers in NUM and the yemassee in NUM
lydia maria child wrote hobomok in NUM and the rebels in NUM
john neal wrote logan a family history in NUM rachel dyer in NUM and the down-easters in NUM
catherine maria sedgwick wrote a new england tale in NUM redwood in NUM hope leslie in NUM and the linwoods in NUM
james kirke paulding wrote the lion of the west in NUM the dutchmans fireside in NUM and westward ho
in NUM
robert montgomery bird wrote calavar in NUM and nick of the woods in NUM
james fenimore cooper was also a notable author best known for his novel the last of the mohicans written in NUM
george tucker produced in NUM the first fiction of virginia colonial life with the valley of shenandoah
he followed in NUM with one of the countrys first science fictions a voyage to the moon with some account of the manners and customs science and philosophy of the people of morosofia and other lunarians 
after the war of NUM there was an increasing desire to produce a uniquely american literature and culture and a number of literary figures emerged among them washington irving william cullen bryant and james fenimore cooper 
irving wrote humorous works in salmagundi and the satire a history of new york by diedrich knickerbocker NUM
bryant wrote early romantic and nature-inspired poetry which evolved away from their european origins 
coopers leatherstocking tales about natty bumppo which includes the last of the mohicans were popular both in the new country and abroad 
in NUM edgar allan poe began writing short stories  including the masque of the red death the pit and the pendulum the fall of the house of usher and the murders in the rue morgue  that explore previously hidden levels of human psychology and push the boundaries of fiction toward mystery and fantasy 
humorous writers were also popular and included seba smith and benjamin penhallow shillaber in new england and davy crockett augustus baldwin longstreet johnson j hooper thomas bangs thorpe and george washington harris writing about the american frontier 
the new england brahmins were a group of writers connected to harvard university and cambridge massachusetts 
they included james russell lowell henry wadsworth longfellow and oliver wendell holmes sr 
in NUM ralph waldo emerson a former minister published his essay nature which argued that men should dispense with organized religion and reach a lofty spiritual state by studying and interacting with the natural world 
emersons work influenced the writers who formed the movement now known as transcendentalism while emerson also influenced the public through his lectures 
among the leaders of the transcendental movement was henry david thoreau a nonconformist and a close friend of emerson 
after living mostly by himself for two years in a cabin by a wooded pond thoreau wrote walden a memoir that urges resistance to the dictates of society 
thoreaus writings demonstrate a strong american tendency toward individualism 
other transcendentalists included amos bronson alcott margaret fuller george ripley orestes brownson and jones very 
as one of the great works of the revolutionary period was written by a frenchman so too was a work about america from this generation 
alexis de tocquevilles two-volume democracy in america described his travels through the young nation making observations about the relations between american politics individualism and community 
the political conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired the writings of william lloyd garrison and his paper the liberator along with poet john greenleaf whittier and harriet beecher stowe in her world-famous uncle toms cabin
these efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narrative autobiography of which the best known examples from this period include frederick douglasss narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave and harriet jacobss incidents in the life of a slave girl
at the same time american indian autobiography develops most notably in william apesss a son of the forest and george copways the life history and travels of kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh
moreover minority authors were beginning to publish fiction as in william wells browns clotel or the presidents daughter frank j webbs the garies and their friends martin delanys blake or the huts of america and harriet e wilsons our nig as early african american novels and john rollin ridges the life and adventures of joaquin murieta the celebrated california bandit which is considered the first native american novel but which also is an early story about mexican american issues 
in NUM the young nathaniel hawthorne NUM collected some of his stories as twice-told tales a volume rich in symbolism and occult incidents 
hawthorne went on to write full-length romances quasi-allegorical novels that explore the themes of guilt pride and emotional repression in new england 
his masterpiece the scarlet letter is a drama about a woman cast out of her community for committing adultery 
hawthornes fiction had a profound impact on his friend herman melville NUM who first made a name for himself by turning material from his seafaring days into exotic sea narrative novels 
inspired by hawthornes focus on allegories and psychology melville went on to write romances replete with philosophical speculation 
in moby-dick an adventurous whaling voyage becomes the vehicle for examining such themes as obsession the nature of evil and human struggle against the elements 
in the short novel billy budd melville dramatizes the conflicting claims of duty and compassion on board a ship in time of war 
his more profound books sold poorly and he had been long forgotten by the time of his death 
he was rediscovered in the early NUMth century 
anti-transcendental works from melville hawthorne and poe all comprise the dark romanticism sub-genre of popular literature at this time 
american dramatic literature by contrast remained dependent on european models although many playwrights did attempt to apply these forms to american topics and themes such as immigrants westward expansion temperance etc 
at the same time american playwrights created several long-lasting american character types especially the yankee the negro and the indian exemplified by the characters of jonathan sambo and metamora 
in addition new dramatic forms were created in the tom shows the showboat theater and the minstrel show 
among the best plays of the period are james nelson barkers superstition or the fanatic father anna cora mowatts fashion or life in new york nathaniel bannisters putnam the iron son of NUM dion boucicaults the octoroon or life in louisiana and cornelius mathewss witchcraft or the martyrs of salem
the fireside poets also known as the schoolroom or household poets were some of americas first major poets domestically and internationally 
they were known for their poems being easy to memorize due to their general adherence to poetic form standard forms regular meter and rhymed stanzas and were often recited in the home hence the name as well as in school such as paul reveres ride as well as working with distinctly american themes including some political issues such as abolition 
they included henry wadsworth longfellow william cullen bryant john greenleaf whittier james russell lowell and oliver wendell holmes sr . longfellow achieved the highest level of acclaim and is often considered the first internationally acclaimed american poet being the first american poet given a bust in westminster abbeys poets corner 
walt whitmanNUM and emily dickinson NUM two of americas greatest NUMth-century poets could hardly have been more different in temperament and style 
walt whitman was a working man a traveler a self-appointed nurse during the american civil war NUM and a poetic innovator 
his magnum opus was leaves of grass in which he uses a free-flowing verse and lines of irregular length to depict the all-inclusiveness of american democracy 
taking that motif one step further the poet equates the vast range of american experience with himself without being egotistical 
for example in song of myself the long central poem in leaves of grass whitman writes these are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands they are not original with me  ..

in his words whitman was a poet of the body electric
in studies in classic american literature the english novelist d h lawrence wrote that whitman was the first to smash the old moral conception that the soul of man is something superior and above the flesh 
by contrast emily dickinson lived the sheltered life of a genteel unmarried woman in small-town amherst massachusetts 
her poetry is ingenious witty and penetrating 
her work was unconventional for its day and little of it was published during her lifetime 
many of her poems dwell on the topic of death often with a mischievous twist 
one because i could not stop for death begins he kindly stopped for me 
the opening of another dickinson poem toys with her position as a woman in a male-dominated society and an unrecognized poet im nobody
who are you
 are you nobody too
american poetry arguably reached its peak in the early-to-mid-NUMth century with such noted writers as wallace stevens and his harmonium NUM and the auroras of autumn NUM t s eliot and his the waste land NUM robert frost and his north of boston NUM and new hampshire NUM hart crane and his white buildings NUM and the epic cycle the bridge NUM ezra pound william carlos williams and his epic poem about his new jersey hometown paterson marianne moore e e cummings edna st vincent millay and langston hughes in addition to many others 
mark twain the pen name used by samuel langhorne clemens NUM was the first major american writer to be born away from the east coast  in the border state of missouri 
his regional masterpieces were the memoir life on the mississippi and the novels adventures of tom sawyer and adventures of huckleberry finn
twains style  influenced by journalism wedded to the vernacular direct and unadorned but also highly evocative and irreverently humorous  changed the way americans write their language 
his characters speak like real people and sound distinctively american using local dialects newly invented words and regional accents 
other writers interested in regional differences and dialect were george w cable thomas nelson page joel chandler harris mary noailles murfree charles egbert craddock sarah orne jewett mary e wilkins freeman henry cuyler bunner and william sydney porter o henry
a version of local color regionalism that focused on minority experiences can be seen in the works of charles w chesnutt african american of mara ruiz de burton one of the earliest mexican american novelists to write in english and in the yiddish-inflected works of abraham cahan 
william dean howells also represented the realist tradition through his novels including the rise of silas lapham and his work as editor of the atlantic monthly
henry james NUM confronted the old world-new world dilemma by writing directly about it 
although he was born in new york city james spent most of his adult life in england 
many of his novels center on americans who live in or travel to europe 
with its intricate highly qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance jamess fiction can be daunting 
among his more accessible works are the novellas daisy miller about an american girl in europe and the turn of the screw a ghost story 
realism began to influence american drama partly through howells but also through europeans such as ibsen and zola 
although realism was most influential in set design and stagingaudiences loved the special effects offered up by the popular melodramasand in the growth of local color plays it also showed up in the more subdued less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the civil war and continued social turmoil on the american psyche 
the most ambitious attempt at bringing modern realism into the drama was james hernes margaret fleming which addressed issues of social determinism through realistic dialogue psychological insight and symbolism 
the play was not successful and both critics and audiences thought it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes such as the main character nursing her husbands illegitimate child onstage 
at the beginning of the NUMth century american novelists were expanding fiction to encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the naturalist school of realism 
in her stories and novels edith wharton NUM scrutinized the upper-class eastern-seaboard society in which she had grown up 
one of her finest books the age of innocence centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider 
at about the same time stephen crane NUM best known for his civil war novel the red badge of courage depicted the life of new york city prostitutes in 
and in sister carrie theodore dreiser NUM portrayed a country girl who moves to chicago and becomes a kept woman 
hamlin garland and frank norris wrote about the problems of american farmers and other social issues from a naturalist perspective 
political writings discussed social issues and the power of corporations 
edward bellamys looking backward outlined other possible political and social orders and upton sinclair most famous for his muck-raking novel the jungle advocated socialism 
other political writers of the period included edwin markham and william vaughn moody 
journalistic critics including ida m tarbell and lincoln steffens were labeled the muckrakers
henry brooks adamss literate autobiography the education of henry adams also depicted a stinging description of the education system and modern life 
race was a common issue as well as seen in the work of pauline hopkins who published five influential works from NUM to NUM
similarly sui sin far wrote about chinese-american experiences and maria cristina mena wrote about mexican-american experiences 
the NUMs brought sharp changes to american literature 
many writers had direct experience of the first world war and they used it to frame their writings 
experimentation in style and form soon joined the new freedom in subject matter 
in NUM gertrude stein NUM by then an expatriate in paris published three lives an innovative work of fiction influenced by her familiarity with cubism jazz and other movements in contemporary art and music 
stein labeled a group of american literary notables who lived in paris in the NUMs and NUMs the lost generation
the poet ezra pound NUM was born in idaho but spent much of his adult life in europe 
his work is complex sometimes obscure with multiple references to other art forms and to a vast range of literature both western and eastern 
he influenced many other poets notably t s eliot NUM another expatriate 
eliot wrote spare cerebral poetry carried by a dense structure of symbols 
in the waste land he embodied a jaundiced vision of postworld war i society in fragmented haunted images 
like pounds eliots poetry could be highly allusive and some editions of the waste land come with footnotes supplied by the poet 
in NUM eliot won the nobel prize in literature 
henry james stein pound and eliot demonstrate the growth of an international perspective in american literature 
american writers had long looked to european models for inspiration but whereas the literary breakthroughs of the mid-NUMth century came from finding distinctly american styles and themes writers from this period were finding ways of contributing to a flourishing international literary scene not as imitators but as equals 
something similar was happening back in the states as jewish writers such as abraham cahan used the english language to reach an international jewish audience 
american writers also expressed the disillusionment following upon the war 
the stories and novels of f scott fitzgerald NUM capture the restless pleasure-hungry defiant mood of the NUMs 
fitzgeralds characteristic theme expressed poignantly in the great gatsby is the tendency of youths golden dreams to dissolve in failure and disappointment 
fitzgerald also elucidates the collapse of some key american ideals such as liberty social unity good governance and peace features which were severely threatened by the pressures of modern early NUMth century society 
sinclair lewis and sherwood anderson also wrote novels with critical depictions of american life 
john dos passos wrote about the war and also the us a trilogy which extended into the depression 
ernest hemingway NUM saw violence and death first-hand as an ambulance driver in world war i and the carnage persuaded him that abstract language was mostly empty and misleading 
he cut out unnecessary words from his writing simplified the sentence structure and concentrated on concrete objects and actions 
he adhered to a moral code that emphasized grace under pressure and his protagonists were strong silent men who often dealt awkwardly with women 
the sun also rises and a farewell to arms are generally considered his best novels in NUM he won the nobel prize in literature 
william faulkner NUM won the nobel prize in NUM faulkner encompassed an enormous range of humanity in yoknapatawpha county a mississippian region of his own invention 
he recorded his characters seemingly unedited ramblings in order to represent their inner states a technique called stream of consciousness
in fact these passages are carefully crafted and their seemingly chaotic structure conceals multiple layers of meaning 
he also jumbled time sequences to show how the past  especially the slave-holding era of the deep south  endures in the present 
among his great works are absalom absalom
 as i lay dying the sound and the fury and light in august
although the american theatrical tradition can be traced back to the arrival of lewis hallams troupe in the mid-NUMth century and was very active in the NUMth century as seen by the popularity of minstrel shows and of adaptations of uncle toms cabin american drama attained international status only in the NUMs and NUMs with the works of eugene oneill who won four pulitzer prizes and the nobel prize 
in the middle of the NUMth century american drama was dominated by the work of playwrights tennessee williams and arthur miller as well as by the maturation of the american musical which had found a way to integrate script music and dance in such works as oklahoma
and west side story
later american playwrights of importance include edward albee sam shepard david mamet august wilson and tony kushner 
depression era literature was blunt and direct in its social criticism 
john steinbeck NUM was born in salinas california where he set many of his stories 
his style was simple and evocative winning him the favor of the readers but not of the critics 
steinbeck often wrote about poor working-class people and their struggle to lead a decent and honest life 
the grapes of wrath considered his masterpiece is a strong socially-oriented novel that tells the story of the joads a poor family from oklahoma and their journey to california in search of a better life 
other popular novels include tortilla flat of mice and men cannery row and east of eden
he was awarded the nobel prize in literature in NUM
steinbecks contemporary nathanael wests two most famous short novels miss lonelyhearts which plumbs the life of its eponymous antihero a reluctant and to comic effect male advice columnist and the effects the tragic letters exert on it and the day of the locust which introduces a cast of hollywood stereotypes and explores the ironies of the movies have come to be avowed classics of american literature 
in non-fiction james agees let us now praise famous men observes and depicts the lives of three struggling tenant-farming families in alabama in NUM
combining factual reporting with poetic beauty agee presented an accurate and detailed report of what he had seen coupled with insight into his feelings about the experience and the difficulties of capturing it for a broad audience 
in doing so he created an enduring portrait of a nearly invisible segment of the american population 
henry miller assumed a unique place in american literature in the NUMs when his semi-autobiographical novels written and published in paris were banned from the us 
although his major works including tropic of cancer and black spring would not be free of the label of obscenity until NUM their themes and stylistic innovations had already exerted a major influence on succeeding generations of american writers and paved the way for sexually frank NUMs novels by john updike philip roth gore vidal john rechy and william styron 
the period in time from the end of world war ii up until roughly the late NUMs and early NUMs saw the publication of some of the most popular works in american history such as to kill a mockingbird by harper lee 
the last few of the more realistic modernists along with the wildly romantic beatniks largely dominated the period while the direct respondents to americas involvement in world war ii contributed in their notable influence 
though born in canada chicago-raised saul bellow would become one of the most influential novelists in america in the decades directly following world war ii 
in works like the adventures of augie march and herzog bellow painted vivid portraits of the american city and the distinctive characters that peopled it 
bellow went on to win the nobel prize for literature in NUM
from jd 
salingers nine stories and the catcher in the rye to sylvia plaths the bell jar the perceived madness of the state of affairs in america was brought to the forefront of the nations literary expression 
immigrant authors such as vladimir nabokov with lolita forged on with the theme and at almost the same time the beatniks took a concerted step away from their lost generation predecessors developing a style and tone of their own by drawing on eastern theology and experimenting with recreational drugs 
the poetry and fiction of the beat generation largely born of a circle of intellects formed in new york city around columbia university and established more officially some time later in san francisco came of age 
the term beat referred all at the same time to the countercultural rhythm of the jazz scene to a sense of rebellion regarding the conservative stress of post-war society and to an interest in new forms of spiritual experience through drugs alcohol philosophy and religion and specifically through zen buddhism 
allen ginsberg set the tone of the movement in his poem howl a whitmanesque work that began i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness .. among the most representative achievements of the beats in the novel are jack kerouacs on the road NUM the chronicle of a soul-searching travel through the continent and william s burroughss naked lunch NUM a more experimental work structured as a series of vignettes relating among other things the narrators travels and experiments with hard drugs 
regarding the war novel specifically there was a literary explosion in america during the postworld war ii era 
some of the best known of the works produced included norman mailers the naked and the dead NUM joseph hellers catch-NUM NUM and kurt vonnegut jr s slaughterhouse-five NUM
the moviegoer NUM by southern author walker percy winner of the national book award was his attempt at exploring the dislocation of man in the modern age 
in contrast john updike approached american life from a more reflective but no less subversive perspective 
his NUM novel rabbit run the first of four chronicling the rising and falling fortunes of harry rabbit angstrom over the course of four decades against the backdrop of the major events of the second half of the NUMth century broke new ground on its release in its characterization and detail of the american middle class and frank discussion of taboo topics such as adultery 
notable among updikes characteristic innovations was his use of present-tense narration his rich stylized language and his attention to sensual detail 
his work is also deeply imbued with christian themes 
the two final installments of the rabbit series rabbit is rich NUM and rabbit at rest NUM were both awarded the pulitzer prize for fiction 
other notable works include the henry bech novels NUM the witches of eastwick NUM rogers version NUM and in the beauty of the lilies NUM which literary critic michiko kakutani called arguably his finest 
frequently linked with updike is the novelist philip roth 
roth vigorously explores jewish identity in american society especially in the postwar era and the early NUMst century 
frequently set in newark new jersey roths work is known to be highly autobiographical and many of roths main characters most famously the jewish novelist nathan zuckerman are thought to be alter egos of roth 
with these techniques and armed with his articulate and fast-paced style roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining american culture 
his most famous work includes the zuckerman novels the controversial portnoys complaint NUM and goodbye columbus NUM
among the most decorated american writers of his generation he has won every major american literary award including the pulitzer prize for his major novel american pastoral NUM
in the realm of african-american literature ralph ellisons NUM novel invisible man was instantly recognized as among the most powerful and important works of the immediate post-war years 
the story of a black underground man in the urban north the novel laid bare the often repressed racial tension that still prevailed while also succeeding as an existential character study 
richard wright was catapulted to fame by the publication in subsequent years of his now widely studied short story the man who was almost a man NUM and his controversial second novel native son NUM and his legacy was cemented by the NUM publication of black boy a work in which wright drew on his childhood and mostly autodidactic education in the segregated south fictionalizing and exaggerating some elements as he saw fit 
because of its polemical themes and wrights involvement with the communist party the novels final part american hunger was not published until NUM
perhaps the most ambitious and challenging post-war american novelist was william gaddis whose uncompromising satiric and large novels such as the recognitions NUM and j r NUM are presented largely in terms of unattributed dialog that requires almost unexampled reader participation 
gaddiss primary themes include forgery capitalism religious zealotry and the legal system constituting a sustained polyphonic critique of modern american life 
gaddiss work though largely ignored for years anticipated and influenced the development of such ambitious postmodern fiction writers as thomas pynchon joseph mcelroy and don delillo 
another neglected and challenging postwar american novelist albeit one who wrote much shorter works was john hawkes whose surreal visionary fiction addresses themes of violence and eroticism and experiments audaciously with narrative voice and style 
among his most important works is the short nightmarish novel the lime twig NUM
in the postwar period the art of the short story again flourished 
among its most respected practitioners was flannery oconnor who developed a distinctive southern gothic esthetic in which characters acted at one level as people and at another as symbols 
a devout catholic oconnor often imbued her stories among them the widely studied a good man is hard to find and everything that rises must converge and two novels wise blood NUM the violent bear it away NUM with deeply religious themes focusing particularly on the search for truth and religious skepticism against the backdrop of the nuclear age 
other important practitioners of the form include katherine anne porter eudora welty john cheever raymond carver tobias wolff and the more experimental donald barthelme 
among the most respected of the postwar american poets are john ashbery the key figure of the surrealistic new york school of poetry and his celebrated self-portrait in a convex mirror pulitzer prize for poetry NUM elizabeth bishop and her north  south pulitzer prize for poetry NUM and geography iii national book award NUM richard wilbur and his things of this world winner of both the pulitzer prize and the national book award for poetry in NUM john berryman and his the dream songs pulitzer prize for poetry NUM national book award NUM ar 
ammons whose collected poems NUM-NUM won a national book award in NUM and whose long poem garbage earned him another in NUM theodore roethke and his the waking pulitzer prize for poetry NUM james merrill and his epic poem of communication with the dead the changing light at sandover pulitzer prize for poetry NUM louise glck for her the wild iris pulitzer prize for poetry NUM ws 
merwin for his the carrier of ladders pulitzer prize for poetry NUM and the shadow of sirius pulitzer prize for poetry NUM mark strand for blizzard of one pulitzer prize for poetry NUM robert hass for his time and materials which won both the pulitzer prize and national book award for poetry in NUM and NUM respectively and rita dove for her thomas and beulah pulitzer prize for poetry NUM
in addition in this same period the confessional whose origin is often traced to the publication in NUM of robert lowells life studies and beat schools of poetry enjoyed popular and academic success producing such widely anthologized voices as allen ginsberg charles bukowski gary snyder anne sexton and sylvia plath among many others 
though its exact parameters remain debatable from the early NUMs to the present day the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism 
thomas pynchon a seminal practitioner of the form drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion unreliable narrators and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction ideogrammatic characterization unrealistic names oedipa maas benny profane etc 
 absurdist plot elements and hyperbolic humor deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms a strong focus on postcolonial themes and a subversive commingling of high and low culture 
in NUM he published gravitys rainbow a leading work in this genre which won the national book award and was unanimously nominated for the pulitzer prize for fiction that year 
his other major works include his debut v  NUM the crying of lot NUM NUM mason  dixon NUM and against the day NUM
toni morrison recipient of the nobel prize for literature writing in a distinctive lyrical prose style published her controversial debut novel the bluest eye to critical acclaim in NUM
coming on the heels of the signing of the civil rights act of NUM the novel widely studied in american schools includes an elaborate description of incestuous rape and explores the conventions of beauty established by a historically racist society painting a portrait of a self-immolating black family in search of beauty in whiteness 
since then morrison has experimented with lyric fantasy as in her two best-known later works song of solomon NUM and beloved NUM for which she was awarded the pulitzer prize for fiction along these lines critic harold bloom has drawn favorable comparisons to virginia woolf and the nobel committee to faulkner and to the latin american tradition of magical realism.
beloved was chosen in a NUM survey conducted by the new york times as the most important work of fiction of the last NUM years 
writing in a lyrical flowing style that eschews excessive use of the comma and semicolon recalling william faulkner and ernest hemingway in equal measure cormac mccarthy seizes on the literary traditions of several regions of the united states and includes multiple genres 
he writes in the southern gothic aesthetic in his faulknerian NUM debut the orchard keeper and suttree NUM in the epic western tradition with grotesquely drawn characters and symbolic narrative turns reminiscent of melville in blood meridian NUM which harold bloom styled the greatest single book since faulkners as i lay dying calling the character of judge holden short of moby dick the most monstrous apparition in all of american literature in a much more pastoral tone in his celebrated border trilogy NUM of bildungsromans including all the pretty horses NUM winner of the national book award and in the post-apocalyptic genre in the pulitzer prize-winning the road NUM
his novels are noted for achieving both commercial and critical success several of his works having been adapted to film 
don delillo who rose to literary prominence with the publication of his NUM novel white noise a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling as a piece of comic social criticism began his writing career in NUM with americana
he is listed by harold bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary american writers in the company of such figures as philip roth cormac mccarthy and thomas pynchon 
his NUM novel underworld chronicles american life through and immediately after the cold war and is usually considered his masterpiece 
it was also the runner-up in a survey that asked writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last NUM years 
among his other important novels are libra NUM mao ii NUM and falling man NUM
seizing on the distinctly postmodern techniques of digression narrative fragmentation and elaborate symbolism and strongly influenced by the works of thomas pynchon david foster wallace began his writing career with the broom of the system published to moderate acclaim in NUM
his second novel infinite jest NUM a futuristic portrait of america and a playful critique of the media-saturated nature of american life has been consistently ranked among the most important works of the NUMth century and his final novel unfinished at the time of his death the pale king NUM has garnered much praise and attention 
in addition to his novels he also authored three acclaimed short story collections girl with curious hair NUM brief interviews with hideous men NUM and  NUM
jonathan franzen wallaces friend and contemporary rose to prominence after the NUM publication of his national book award-winning third novel the corrections
he began his writing career in NUM with the well-received the twenty-seventh city a novel centering on his native st louis but did not gain national attention until the publication of his essay perchance to dream in harpers magazine discussing the cultural role of the writer in the new millennium through the prism of his own frustrations 
the corrections a tragicomedy about the disintegrating lambert family has been called the literary phenomenon of its decade and was ranked as one of the greatest novels of the past century 
in NUM he published freedom to great critical acclaim 
other notable writers at the turn of the century include michael chabon whose pulitzer prize-winning the amazing adventures of kavalier  clay NUM tells the story of two friends joe kavalier and sam clay as they rise through the ranks of the comics industry in its heyday denis johnson whose NUM novel tree of smoke about falsified intelligence during vietnam both won the national book award and was a finalist for the pulitzer prize for fiction and was called by critic michiko kakutani one of the classic works of literature produced by the vietnam war and louise erdrich whose NUM novel the plague of doves a distinctly faulknerian polyphonic examination of the tribal experience set against the backdrop of murder in the fictional town of pluto north dakota was nominated for the pulitzer prize and her NUM novel the round house which builds on the same themes was awarded the NUM national book award 
one of the developments in late-NUMth-century american literature was the increase of literature written by and about ethnic minorities beyond african americans and jewish americans 
this development came alongside the growth of the civil rights movements and its corollary the ethnic pride movement which led to the creation of ethnic studies programs in most major universities 
these programs helped establish the new ethnic literature as worthy objects of academic study alongside such other new areas of literary study as womens literature gay and lesbian literature working-class literature postcolonial literature and the rise of literary theory as a key component of academic literary study 
after being relegated to cookbooks and autobiographies for most of the NUMth century asian american literature achieved widespread notice through maxine hong kingstons fictional memoir the woman warrior NUM and her novels china men NUM and tripmaster monkey his fake book
chinese-american author ha jin in NUM won the national book award for his second novel waiting about a chinese soldier in the revolutionary army who has to wait NUM years to divorce his wife for another woman all the while having to worry about persecution for his protracted affair and twice won the penfaulkner award in NUM for waiting and in NUM for war trash
indian-american author jhumpa lahiri won the pulitzer prize for fiction for her debut collection of short stories interpreter of maladies NUM and went on to write a well-received novel the namesake NUM which was shortly adapted to film in NUM
in her second collection of stories unaccustomed earth released to widespread commercial and critical success lahiri shifts focus and treats the experiences of the second and third generation 
other notable asian-american novelists include amy tan best known for her novel the joy luck club NUM tracing the lives of four immigrant families brought together by the game of mahjong and korean american novelist chang-rae lee who has published native speaker a gesture life and aloft 
such poets as marilyn chin and li-young lee kimiko hahn and janice mirikitani have also achieved prominence as has playwright david henry hwang 
equally important has been the effort to recover earlier asian american authors started by frank chin and his colleagues this effort has brought sui sin far toshio mori carlos bulosan john okada hisaye yamamoto and others to prominence 
hispanic literature also became important during this period starting with acclaimed novels by toms rivera ...y no se lo trag la tierra and rudolfo anaya bless me ultima and the emergence of chicano theater with luis valdez and teatro campesino
latina writing became important thanks to authors such as sandra cisneros an icon of an emerging chicano literature whose NUM bildungsroman the house on mango street is taught in schools across the united states denise chavezs the last of the menu girls and gloria anzaldas 
dominican-american author junot daz received the pulitzer prize for fiction for his NUM novel the brief wondrous life of oscar wao which tells the story of an overweight dominican boy growing up as a social outcast in paterson new jersey

spurred by the success of n scott momadays pulitzer prizewinning house made of dawn native american literature showed explosive growth during this period known as the native american renaissance through such novelists as leslie marmon silko eg  ceremony gerald vizenor eg   and numerous essays on native american literature louise erdrich love medicine and several other novels that use a recurring set of characters and locations in the manner of william faulkner james welch eg  winter in the blood sherman alexie eg  the lone ranger and tonto fistfight in heaven and poets simon ortiz and joy harjo 
the success of these authors has brought renewed attention to earlier generations including zitkala-sa john joseph mathews darcy mcnickle and mourning dove 
more recently arab american literature largely unnoticed since the new york pen league of the NUMs has become more prominent through the work of diana abu-jaber whose novels include arabian jazz and crescent and the memoir the language of baklava

in NUM coopers wife susan wagered that he could write a book better than the one that she was reading 
in response to the wager cooper wrote the novel precaution NUM
its focus on morals and manners was influenced by jane austens approach to fiction

in NUM cooper entered the lists as a political writer in a series of letters to le national a parisian journal 
he defended the united states against a string of charges brought by the revue britannique
for the rest of his life he continued skirmishing in print sometimes for the national interest sometimes for that of the individual and frequently for both at once 
this opportunity to make a political confession of faith reflected the political turn that he already had taken in his fiction having attacked european anti-republicanism in the bravo NUM
cooper continued this political course in the heidenmauer NUM and  NUM
the bravo depicted venice as a place where a ruthless oligarchy lurks behind the mask of the serene republic
all were widely read on both sides of the atlantic though the bravo was a critical failure in the united states 
in NUM cooper returned to the united states and published a letter to my countrymen in which he gave his criticism of various social mores

encouraged by your kindness i will take this opportunity of recording the deeds and sufferings of abrclass of men to which this nation owes a debt of gratitude  a class of men among whom i am alwaysbrready to declare not only the earliest but many of the happiest days of my youth have been passed 
his historical account of the us navy was first well received but later harshly criticized in america and abroad 
it took cooper NUM years to research and gather material for the book 
his close association with the us navy and various officers and his familiarity with naval life at sea provided him the background and connections to research and write this work 
coopers work is said to have stood the test of time and is considered an authoritative account of the us navy during that time 
in NUM coopers proceedings of the naval court martial in the case of alexander slidell mackenzie a commander in the navy of the united states c was first published in grahams magazine of NUM

in NUM five years after coopers death his history of the navy of the united states of america was published 
the work was an account of the us navy in the early NUMth century 
among naval historians of today the work has come to be recognized as a general and authoritative account 
however it was criticized for accuracy on some points by other students of that period 
for example coopers account of the battle of lake erie was said to be less than accurate by some naval historians 
for making such claims cooper once sued park benjamin sr for libel a poet and editor of the evening signal of new york 
coopers books related to current politics coupled with his self-promotion increased the ill feeling between the author and the public 
the whig press was virulent in its comments about him and cooper filed legal actions for libel winning all his lawsuits 
after concluding his last case in court cooper returned to writing with more energy and success than hed had for several years 
on may NUM NUM he published his history of the us navy and returned to the leatherstocking tales series with the pathfinder or the inland sea NUM and the deerslayer NUM and other novels 
he wrote again on maritime themes including ned myers or a life before the mast which is of particular interest to naval historians 
in the late NUMs cooper returned to his public attacks on his critics and enemies in a series of novels called the littlepage trilogy where he defended landowners along the hudson river lending them social and political support against rebellious tenant farmers in the anti-rent wars that marked this period 
one of his later novels was the crater an allegory of the rise and fall of the united states authored in NUM
his growing sense of historical doom was exemplified in this work 
at the end of his career he wrote a scornful satire about american social life and legal practices called the ways of the hour authored in NUM
he turned again from pure fiction to the combination of art and controversy in which he had achieved distinction with the littlepage manuscripts NUM
his next novel was the crater or vulcans peak NUM in which he attempted to introduce supernatural machinery 
jack tier NUM was a remaking of the red rover and the ways of the hour was his last completed novel 
cooper spent the last years of his life back in cooperstown 
he died on september NUM NUM the day before NUMnd birthday 
he was buried in the christ episcopal churchyard where his father william cooper was buried 
coopers wife susan survived her husband only by a few months and was buried by his side at cooperstown 
several well-known writers politicians and other public figures honored coopers memory with a dinner in new york six months after his death in february NUM
daniel webster presided over the event and gave a speech to the gathering while washington irving served as a co-chairman along with william cullen bryant who also gave an address which did much to restore coopers damaged reputation among american writers of the time

he was an active member of christ episcopal church which at the time was a small parish in cooperstown not far from his home 
much later in his life in NUM he became its warden and vestryman 
as the vestryman he donated generously to this church and later supervised and redesigned its interior with oak furnishings at his own expense 
in july NUM he was confirmed in this church by the reverend mr birdsall 
cooper was one of the most popular NUMth-century american authors and his work was admired greatly throughout the world 
while on his death bed the austrian composer franz schubert wanted most to read more of coopers novels 
honor de balzac the french novelist and playwright admired him greatly 
henry david thoreau while attending harvard incorporated some of coopers style in his own work 
coopers work particularly the pioneers and  demonstrate an early NUMth-century american preoccupation with alternating prudence and negligence in a country where property rights were often still in dispute 
cooper was one of the first major american novelists to include african african-american and native american characters in his works 
in particular native americans play central roles in his leatherstocking tales 
however his treatment of this group is complex and highlights the tenuous relationship between frontier settlers and american indians as exemplified in the wept of wish-ton-wish depicting a captured white girl who is taken care of by an indian chief and who after several years is eventually returned to her parents 
often he gives contrasting views of native characters to emphasize their potential for good or conversely their proclivity for mayhem 
last of the mohicans includes both the character of magua who is devoid of almost any redeeming qualities as well as chingachgook the last chief of the mohicans who is portrayed as noble courageous and heroic 
in NUM cooper was elected into the national academy of design as an honorary academician 
according to tad szulc cooper was a devotee of polands causes uprisings to regain polish sovereignty
he brought flags of the defeated polish rebel regiment from warsaw and presented them to the exiled leaders in paris 
and although cooper and marquis de la fayette were friends it remains unclear how cooper found himself in warsaw at that historical moment although he was an active supporter of european democratic movements 
though some scholars have hesitated to classify cooper as a strict romantic victor hugo pronounced him greater than the great master of modern romance 
this verdict was echoed by a multitude of less famous readers such as balzac and rudolf drescher of germany who were satisfied with no title for their favorite less than that of the american scott 
mark twain famously criticized the deerslayer and the pathfinder in his satirical but shrewdly observant essay fenimore coopers literary offenses NUM which portrays coopers writing as cliched and overwrought 
cooper was honored on a us commemorative stamp the famous american series issued in NUM.

cooper was also criticized heavily for his depiction of women characters in his work 
james russell lowell coopers contemporary and a critic referred to it poetically in a fable for critics writing 


the women he draws from one model dont vary  all sappy as maples and flat as a prairie 
coopers lasting reputation today rests largely upon the five leatherstocking tales 
as for the remaining body of his work literary scholar leslie fiedler notes that coopers collected works are monumental in their cumulative dullness 
three dining halls at the state university of new york at oswego are named in coopers remembrance cooper hall the pathfinder and littlepage because of his temporary residence in oswego and for setting some of his works there 
the gilded and red tole chandelier hanging in the library of the white house in washington dc is from the family of james fenimore cooper 
it was brought there through the efforts of first lady jacqueline kennedy in her great white house restoration 
the james fenimore cooper memorial prize at new york university is awarded annually to an outstanding undergraduate student of journalism 
in NUM cooper was inducted into the new york writers hall of fame 
coopers novels were very popular in the rest of the world including for instance russia 
in particular great interest of the russian public in coopers work was primarily incited by the novel the pathfinder which the renowned russian literary critic vissarion belinsky declared to be a shakespearean drama in the form of a novel
the author was more recognizable by his exotic to many in russia middle name fenimore and this name specifically became a symbol of exciting adventures 
for example in the NUM soviet movie the secret of fenimore  being the third part of a childrens television mini-series three cheerful shifts  see  tells of a mysterious stranger known as fenimore visiting a boys dorm in a summer camp nightly and relating fascinating stories about indians and extraterrestrials

he makes it to miles city montana and collapses unconscious waking to find that a doctor has sawed off his gangrenous leg

in town call finds that the saloon has burned down the proprietor was in love with lorena and committed suicide after her departure 
lonesome dove was the winner of the NUM pulitzer prize for fiction 
the novel received favorable reviews 
in the new york times nicholas lemann praised the novel as thrilling and almost perfectly realized calling it the great cowboy novel 
mcmurtry himself eventually expressed dissatisfaction with the popularity of the novel particularly after the miniseries adaptation 
in the preface to the NUM edition he wrote its hard to go wrong if one writes at length about the old west still the phantom leg of the american psyche 
i thought i had written about a harsh time and some pretty harsh people but to the public at large i had produced something nearer to an idealization instead of a poor mans inferno filled with violence faithlessness and betrayal i had actually delivered a kind of gone with the wind of the west a turnabout ill be mulling over for a long long time 
a television miniseries adaptation produced by motown productions was broadcast on cbs in NUM starring robert duvall as augustus mccrae and tommy lee jones as woodrow f call 
the series was a commercial and critical success eventually garnering a cult following 
according to mcmurtry gus and call were not modeled after historical characters but there are similarities with real-life cattle drivers charles goodnight and oliver loving 
when goodnight and lovings african american guide bose ikard died goodnight carved a wooden grave marker for him just as call does for deets 
upon lovings death goodnight brought him home to be buried in texas as call does for augustus 
goodnight himself appears as a minor but generally sympathetic character in this novel and more so in the sequel streets of laredo and the prequels dead mans walk and comanche moon.
according to mcmurtrys memoir books a memoir the ultimate sources for gus and call were don the crazy old knight and sancho the peasant pragmatist from don quixote
he stated what is important that early on i read some version of don quixote and pondered the grave differences comically cast between sancho and the don 
between the two is where fiction as ive mostly read and written it lives 
other books of the lonesome dove series feature more-prominent historical events and locations such as the texan santa fe expedition the great raid of NUM and the king ranch and characters such as buffalo hump john wesley hardin and judge roy bean 
underworld delillo novel

underworld is a novel published in NUM by don delillo 
it was nominated for the national book award was a best-seller and is one of delillos better-known novels 
underworld continues to receive general acclaim from literary critics 
in NUM a survey of eminent authors and critics conducted by the new york times found underworld  the runner-up for the best work of american fiction of the past NUM years it garnered NUM of NUM votes finishing behind only toni morrisons beloved with NUM votes 
underworld is a non-linear narrative that has many intertwined themes 
a central character is nick shay a waste management executive who leads an undirected existence in late NUMth-century america 
his wife marian is having an affair with one of his friends 
the events of the novel span from the NUMs through the NUMs 
the characters in the book respond to several historical events including the cuban missile crisis and nuclear proliferation 
the novel is divided into eight sections

delillo said that the novels title came to him as he thought about radioactive waste buried deep underground and about pluto god of death 
the waste and byproducts of history dissected and discussed throughout the novel constantly resurface from the underworld or subconscious of the american population despite their best attempts to repress and bury things they would rather forget 
further connections and connotations about the title can be made between part of the novels subject matter mafia criminals in new york who nick shay fantasizes may have had his father killed and the NUM gangster film of the same name 
the novel opens on october NUM NUM when a boy named cotter martin sneaks in to watch the new york giants play the brooklyn dodgers at the giants home field polo grounds 
the prologue pafko at the wall was written on its own before the novel 
in the ninth inning ralph branca pitches to bobby thomson who hits the ball into the stands for a three-run homer beating the dodgers NUM-NUM and capturing the national league pennant 
known to baseball fans as the shot heard round the world the fate of that ball is unknown but in delillos novel cotter martin wrests this valuable ball away from another fan who has just befriended him and runs home 
cotters father manx steals the ball and later sells it for NUM.NUM
branca and thomson are never given much screen time and jackie gleason and frank sinatra only put in cameos but other historical figures become important parts of the story 
j edgar hoover muses on death loyalty and leather masks while comedian lenny bruce faces the cuban missile crisis by impersonating a hysterical housewife shrieking were all gonna die
early in the novel it is revealed that nick shay was in a prison for murdering a man but it is not until near the end of the book that we learn the details of his crime 
after being released from the detention center he is sent to a jesuit reform school in northern minnesota 
in the epilogue we learn that nick and marian remain married despite infidelity on both sides 
in fact nick indicates their relationship is much improved as he has opened up to her about his past  a subject that had always much interested her  and that he had been unwilling to discuss 
underworld received high acclaim from literary critics particularly for delillos prose and ambition 
david wiegand of the san francisco chronicle declaring it delillos best novel and perhaps that most elusive of creatures a great american novel 
many have described the book as emotionally powerful 
david foster wallace wrote delillo a letter in NUM praising the novel and delillos talent 
he described the book as an organic thing and stated that this novel is NUM a great and significant piece of art fictionNUMa not like any novel ive readNUM your best work ever so far NUM a huge reward for someone whos read all your previous stuff because it seems to be at once a synthesis and a transfiguration  a transcendence  of your previous stuff NUM a book in which nothing is skimped or shirked or tossed off or played for the easy laugh and where it seems to me youve taken some truly ballsy personal risks and exposed parts of yourself and hit a level of emotion youve never even tried for elsewhereat least as ive read your work.he also remarked on the phonetics of the novel telling delillo you use these saxonic devices heavily and over and over and yet the prose never seems heavy or straining in fact just the opposite it always seems exquisitely controlled sober poised rather than lunging 
other critics however praised delillos prose but found the novel overlong and argued it could have benefited from more editing 
on saloncom laura miller wrote that nicks secret the one that supposedly provides the books suspense proves anticlimactic 
in may NUM the new york times book review named underworld as a runner up for the best work of american fiction of the previous NUM years 
the well-known literary critic harold bloom although also expressing reservations about the books length has said underworld is the culmination of what delillo can do and one of the few contemporary american works of fiction that touched what i would call the sublime along with works by cormac mccarthy blood meridian philip roth american pastoral and sabbaths theater and thomas pynchon mason  dixon gravitys rainbow and the crying of lot NUM
the novel has j edgar hoover utterly intrigued by the triumph of death a painting by pieter bruegel the elder 
hoover first sees the painting while at the baseball game the painting was reproduced in life and pieces of it fall on him when someone in the stands above tears up the magazine and tosses the pieces 
later in the book he obtains a print of the painting 
several segments of the novel are named in homage to other works 
das kapital is karl marxs magnum opus long tall sally is a song by little richard also famous as a cover by the beatles and cocksucker blues is an infamous unreleased rolling stones song and film 
better things for better living through chemistry was an advertising slogan for dupont while the cloud of unknowing is an anonymous work of christian mysticism written in middle english in the latter half of the NUMth century 
the novel incorporates a number of historical events 
the prologue is about the shot heard round the world and the whereabouts of the ball hit by thomson are a recurrent element of the book 
the book also employs lenny bruces reaction to the cuban missile crisis and soviet unions atomic weapons program including their testing grounds in kazakhstan
delillo has said that the front page of the new york times on october NUM NUM inspired underworld
in NUM underworld was a finalist for the national book award 
underworld was a nominated finalist for the NUM pulitzer prize 
underworld was the winner of the NUM william dean howells medal 
the novel was at one point optioned by producer scott rudin for a film adaptation before it lapsed 
in NUM robert greenwald held the rights and was in discussions for turning it into a television miniseries

in later years hemingway would give dos passos the derogatory moniker of the pilot fish in his memoir of NUMs paris a moveable feast.
of communism dos passos would later write i have come to think especially since my trip to spain that civil liberties must be protected at every stage 
in spain i am sure that the introduction of gpu methods by the communists did as much harm as their tank men pilots and experienced military men did good 
the trouble with an all powerful secret police in the hands of fanatics or of anybody is that once it gets started theres no stopping it until it has corrupted the whole body politic

in the NUMs dos passos also contributed to publications such as the history magazine american heritage for which he wrote essays on thomas jefferson the marquis de sade aaron burr and robert morris the libertarian journal the freeman and the conservative magazine national review
in the same decade he published the influential study the head and heart of thomas jefferson NUM about which fellow ex-radical max eastman wrote i think john dos passos has done a great service to his country and the free world by lending his talents to this task 
he has revived the heart and mind of jefferson not by psycho-analytical lucubrations or soulful gush but in the main by telling story after story of those whose lives and thoughts impinged upon his 
and jeffersons mind and heart are so livingly related to our problems today that the result seems hardly to be history 
recognition for his significant contribution to literature would come thirty years later in europe when in NUM he was invited to rome to accept the prestigious antonio feltrinelli prize for international distinction in literature

many of his books published during the ensuing ten years used jackets and illustrations that dos passos created 
influenced by various movements he merged elements of impressionism expressionism and cubism to create his own unique style 
and his work evolved with his first exhibition at new yorks national arts club in NUM and the following year at gertrude vanderbilt whitneys studio club in new york city 
while dos passos never gained recognition as a great artist he continued to paint throughout his lifetime and his body of work was well respected 
his art most often reflected his travels in spain mexico north africa plus the streets and cafs of the montparnasse quarter of paris that he had frequented with good friends fernand lger ernest hemingway blaise cendrars and others 
between NUM and NUM dos passos wrote plays as well as created posters and set designs for the new playwrights theatre in new york city 
in his later years his attention turned to painting scenes around his residences in maine and virginia 
in early NUM an exhibition titled the art of john dos passos opened at the queens borough library in new york city 
it toured to several locations throughout the united states 
dos passos pioneering works of nonlinear fiction were a major influence in the field 
in particular alfred dblins berlin alexanderplatz and jean-paul sartres roads to freedom trilogy show the influence of his methods 
in an often cited NUM essay sartre referred to dos passos as the greatest writer of our time 
american writer mary mccarthy said that the NUMnd parallel was among the chief influences on her own work 
in the television documentary the odyssey of john dos passos NUM writer norman mailer said those three volumes of us a make up the idea of a great american novel 
science fiction writers have also been influenced by dos passoss works 
john brunners non-novel stand on zanzibar NUM which won the hugo award features his technique of using fictitious newspaper clippings television announcements and other samples taken from the news and entertainment media of the year NUM
while influenced by dos passoss technique brunners work was also inspired by emerging european literary theory on meta-fiction 
joe haldemans novel mindbridge NUM also uses the collage technique 
his short story to howard hughes a modest proposal NUM explored a wealthy man reacting to the threat of war by wielding the power of private atomic reaction 
dos passos is referenced in the fugs song a poem by charles bukowski which criticizes his move to the right 
the NUM american movie hemingway  gellhorn directed by philip kaufman depicts dos passos during the making of a propaganda film the spanish earth which he co-wrote 
the non-fiction work the unwinding NUM by journalist george packer was inspired by the format and style of the us a 
trilogy
he explored a contemporary array of people whose lives express different aspects of american social changes 
the british documentary filmmaker adam curtis says he has been inspired by dos passos and tries to incorporate his technique in film why i love dos passos is he tells political stories but at the same time he also lets you know what it feels like to live through them 
most journalism does not acknowledge that people live at least as much in their heads as they do in the world 
the john dos passos prize is a literary award given annually by the department of english and modern languages at longwood university 
the prize seeks to recognize american creative writers who have produced a substantial body of significant publication that displays characteristics of john dos passos writing an intense and original exploration of specifically american themes an experimental approach to form and an interest in a wide range of human experiences 
the scarlet letter

the scarlet letter a romance an NUM novel is a work of historical fiction written by american author nathaniel hawthorne 
it is considered his masterwork
set in NUMth-century puritan massachusetts bay colony during the years NUM to NUM it tells the story of hester prynne who conceives a daughter through an affair and struggles to create a new life of repentance and dignity 
throughout the book hawthorne explores themes of legalism sin and guilt 
in an extended introduction hawthorne describes his employment in the salem custom house and how he purportedly found an old document and a piece of cloth embroidered with the letter a in a pile of old papers 
this fictitious document being the germ of the story that hawthorne writes as follows 
in june NUM in a puritan boston massachusetts a crowd gathers to witness the punishment of hester prynne a young woman who has given birth to a baby of unknown parentage 
she is required to wear a scarlet a on her dress when she is in front of the townspeople to shame her 
the letter a stands for adulteress although this is never said explicitly in the novel 
her punishment because adultery was illegal at the time is to stand on the scaffold for three hours exposed to public humiliation and to wear the scarlet a for the rest of her life 
as hester approaches the scaffold many of the women in the crowd are angered by her beauty and quiet dignity 
when demanded and cajoled to name the father of her child hester refuses 
as hester looks out over the crowd she notices a small misshapen man and recognizes him as her long-lost husband who has been presumed lost at sea 
when the husband sees hesters shame he asks a man in the crowd about her and is told the story of his wifes adultery 
he angrily exclaims that the childs father the partner in the adulterous act should also be punished and vows to find the man 
he chooses a new name roger chillingworth to aid him in his plan 
the reverend john wilson and the minister of hesters church arthur dimmesdale question the woman but she refuses to name her lover 
after she returns to her prison cell the jailer brings in roger chillingworth a physician to calm hester and her child with his roots and herbs 
he and hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage and the fact that they were both in the wrong 
her lover however is another matter and he demands to know who it is hester refuses to divulge such information 
he accepts this stating that he will find out anyway and forces her to hide that he is her husband 
if she ever reveals him he warns her he will destroy the childs father 
hester agrees to chillingworths terms although she suspects she will regret it 
following her release from prison hester settles in a cottage at the edge of town and earns a meager living with her needlework which is of extraordinary quality 
she lives a quiet somber life with her daughter pearl and performs acts of charity for the poor 
she is troubled by her daughters unusual fascination with hesters scarlet a
the shunning of hester also extends to pearl who has no playmates or friends except her mother 
as she grows older pearl becomes capricious and unruly 
her conduct starts rumours and not surprisingly the church members suggest pearl be taken away from hester 
hester hearing rumors that she may lose pearl goes to speak to governor bellingham 
with him are ministers wilson and dimmesdale 
hester appeals to dimmesdale in desperation and the minister persuades the governor to let pearl remain in hesters care 
because dimmesdales health has begun to fail the townspeople are happy to have chillingworth a newly arrived physician take up lodgings with their beloved minister 
being in such close contact with dimmesdale chillingworth begins to suspect that the ministers illness is the result of some unconfessed guilt 
he applies psychological pressure to the minister because he suspects dimmesdale is pearls father 
one evening pulling the sleeping dimmesdales vestment aside chillingworth sees a symbol that represents his shame on the ministers pale chest 
tormented by his guilty conscience dimmesdale goes to the square where hester was punished years earlier 
climbing the scaffold he admits his guilt but cannot find the courage to do so publicly 
hester shocked by dimmesdales deterioration decides to obtain a release from her vow of silence to her husband 
several days later hester meets dimmesdale in the forest and tells him of her husband and his desire for revenge 
she convinces dimmesdale to leave boston in secret on a ship to europe where they can start life anew 
renewed by this plan the minister seems to gain new energy 
on election day dimmesdale gives what is called one of his most inspired sermons 
but as the procession leaves the church dimmesdale climbs upon the scaffold and confesses his sin dying in hesters arms 
later most witnesses swear that they saw a stigma in the form of a scarlet a upon his chest although some deny this statement 
chillingworth losing his will for revenge dies shortly thereafter and leaves pearl a substantial inheritance 
after several years hester returns to her cottage and resumes wearing the scarlet letter 
when she dies she is buried near the grave of dimmesdale and they share a simple slate tombstone engraved with an escutcheon described as on a field sable the letter a gules on a field black the letter a red
the major theme of the scarlet letter is shaming and social stigmatizing both hesters public humiliation and dimmesdales private shame and fear of exposure 
notably their liaison is never spoken of so the circumstances that lead to hesters pregnancy and how their affair was kept secret never become part of the plot 
elmer kennedy-andrews remarks that hawthorne in the custom-house sets the context for his story and tells us about romance which is his preferred generic term to describe the scarlet letter as his subtitle for the book a romance would indicate 
in this introduction hawthorne describes a space between materialism and dreaminess that he calls a neutral territory somewhere between the real world and fairy-land where the actual and the imaginary may meet and each imbues itself with nature of the other
this combination of dreaminess and realism gave the author space to explore major themes 
the experience of hester and dimmesdale recalls the story of adam and eve because in both cases sin results in expulsion and suffering 
but it also results in knowledge  specifically in knowledge of what it means to be immoral 
for hester the scarlet letter is a physical manifestation of her sin and reminder of her painful solitude 
she contemplates casting it off to obtain her freedom from an oppressive society and a checkered past as well as the absence of god 
because the society excludes her she considers the possibility that many of the traditions held up by the puritan culture are untrue and are not designed to bring her happiness 
as for dimmesdale the cheating minister his sin gives him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind so that his chest vibrates in unison with theirs 
his eloquent and powerful sermons derive from this sense of empathy 
the narrative of the reverend arthur dimmesdale is quite in keeping with the oldest and most fully authorized principles in christian thought 
his fall is a descent from apparent grace to his own damnation he appears to begin in purity but he ends in corruption 
the subtlety is that the ministers belief is his own cheating convincing himself at every stage of his spiritual pilgrimage that he is saved 
the rose bushs beauty forms a striking contrast to all that surrounds it  as later the beautifully embroidered scarlet a will be held out in part as an invitation to find some sweet moral blossom in the ensuing tragic tale and in part as an image that the deep heart of nature perhaps god may look more kindly on the errant hester and her child than her puritan neighbors do 
throughout the work the nature images contrast with the stark darkness of the puritans and their systems 
chillingworths misshapen body reflects or symbolizes the anger in his soul which builds as the novel progresses similar to the way dimmesdales illness reveals his inner turmoil 
the outward man reflects the condition of the heart an observation thought inspired by the deterioration of edgar allan poe whom hawthorne much admired
another theme is the extreme legalism of the puritans and how hester chooses not to conform to their rules and beliefs 
hester was rejected by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor 
because of the social shunning she spent her life mostly in solitude and wouldnt go to church 
as a result she retreats into her own mind and her own thinking 
her thoughts begin to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the puritans as safe or even christian 
she still sees her sin but begins to look on it differently than the villagers ever have 
she begins to believe that a persons earthly sins dont necessarily condemn them 
she even goes so far as to tell dimmesdale that their sin has been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin wont keep them from getting to heaven however the puritans believed that such a sin surely condemns 
but hester had been alienated from the puritan society both in her physical life and spiritual life 
when dimmesdale dies she knows she has to move on because she can no longer conform to the puritans strictness 
her thinking is free from religious bounds and she has established her own different moral standards and beliefs 
it was long thought that hawthorne originally planned the scarlet letter to be a shorter novelette part of a collection named old time legends and that his publisher james thomas fields convinced him to expand the work to a full-length novel 
this is not true fields persuaded hawthorne to publish the scarlet letter alone along with the earlier-completed custom house essay but he had nothing to do with the length of the story 
hawthornes wife sophia later challenged fields claims a little inexactly he has made the absurd boast that he was the sole cause of the scarlet letter being published
she noted that her husbands friend edwin percy whipple a critic approached fields to consider its publication 
the manuscript was written at the peter edgerley house in salem massachusetts still standing as a private residence at NUM mall street 
it was the last salem home where the hawthorne family lived 
the scarlet letter was first published in the spring of NUM by ticknor  fields beginning hawthornes most lucrative period 
when he delivered the final pages to fields in february NUM hawthorne said that some portions of the book are powerfully written but doubted it would be popular 
in fact the book was an instant best-seller though over fourteen years it brought its author only NUM
its initial publication brought wide protest from natives of salem who did not approve of how hawthorne had depicted them in his introduction the custom-house
a NUM-copy second edition included a preface by hawthorne dated march NUM NUM that stated he had decided to reprint his introduction without the change of a word .
the only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine good-humor .. as to enmity or ill-feeling of any kind personal or political he utterly disclaims such motives
the scarlet letter was also one of the first mass-produced books in america 
in the mid-nineteenth century bookbinders of home-grown literature typically hand-made their books and sold them in small quantities 
the first mechanized printing of the scarlet letter NUM volumes sold out within ten days and was widely read and discussed to an extent not much experienced in the young country up until that time 
copies of the first edition are often sought by collectors as rare books and may fetch up to around NUM usd 
on its publication critic evert augustus duyckinck a friend of hawthornes said he preferred the authors washington irving-like tales 
another friend critic edwin percy whipple objected to the novels morbid intensity with dense psychological details writing that the book is therefore apt to become like hawthorne too painfully anatomical in his exhibition of them
english writer mary anne evans writing as george eliot called the scarlet letter along with henry wadsworth longfellows NUM book-length poem the song of hiawatha the two most indigenous and masterly productions in american literature
most literary critics praised the book but religious leaders took issue with the novels subject matter 
orestes brownson complained that hawthorne did not understand christianity confession and remorse 
a review in the church review and ecclesiastical register concluded the author perpetrates bad morals 
on the other hand NUMth-century writer d h lawrence said that there could not be a more perfect work of the american imagination than the scarlet letter
henry james once said of the novel it is beautiful admirable extraordinary it has in the highest degree that merit which i have spoken of as the mark of hawthornes best thingsan indefinable purity and lightness of conception ..one can often return to it it supports familiarity and has the inexhaustible charm and mystery of great works of art 
the following are historical and biblical references that appear in the scarlet letter 
the scarlet letter has inspired numerous film television and stage adaptations and plot elements have influenced several novels musical works and screen productions

an american tragedy

an american tragedy NUM is a novel by the american writer theodore dreiser 
ambitious but ill-educated nave and immature clyde griffiths is raised by poor and devoutly religious parents to help in their street missionary work 
as a young adult clyde must to help support his family take menial jobs as a soda jerk then a bellhop at a prestigious kansas city hotel 
there his more sophisticated colleagues introduce him to bouts of social drinking and sex with some of the hotels female guests and with prostitutes 
enjoying his new lifestyle clyde becomes infatuated with hortense briggs who persuades clyde to buy her an expensive jacket 
when clyde learns hortense desires his colleague sparser not him as a lover he becomes jealous 
hortense repeatedly tells clyde that she loves him while getting him to buy her the jacket for which they are overcharged by a stereotypically greedy jewish shopkeeper
clydes life changes dramatically when sparser driving clyde hortense and other friends back from a secluded rendezvous in the country in a stolen car hits a little girl and kills her 
fleeing from the police at high speed sparser crashes the car 
everyone but sparser and his partner flee the scene of the crime 
clyde leaves kansas city fearing prosecution as an accessory to sparsers crimes 
this pattern of personal irresponsibility and panicked decision-making in clydes life recurs in the story culminating in the central tragedy of the novel 
while working as a bellboy at an exclusive club in chicago he meets his wealthy uncle samuel griffiths the owner of a shirt-collar factory in the fictional city of lycurgus new york 
samuel feeling guilt for neglecting his poor relations offers to help clyde if he will come to lycurgus 
when clyde accepts the offer his uncle gives clyde a menial job at the factory in which clyde makes a very good showing 
after that samuel griffiths gives his nephew clyde a minor supervisory job at the collar factorys offices 
samuel griffiths son gilbert clydes immediate supervisor makes it clear to clyde that as a griffiths he should not consort with the working people of lycurgus and specifically not with the women under his supervision 
as clyde has no close friends in lycurgus he becomes lonely 
emotionally vulnerable clyde is drawn to roberta alden a poor and innocent farm girl working in his office who falls in love with him 
clyde secretly courts roberta ultimately persuading her to have sex with him rather than lose him and makes her pregnant 
at the same time this is happening elegant young socialite sondra finchley daughter of another lycurgus factory owner takes an interest in clyde despite his cousin gilberts efforts to keep them apart 
clydes engaging manner makes him popular among the young smart set of lycurgus he and sondra become close and he courts her as well as roberta 
roberta expects clyde to marry her to avert the shame of an unwed pregnancy but clyde now dreams instead of marrying sondra 
having failed to procure an abortion for roberta clyde doesnt give her more than desultory help with living expenses while his relationship with sondra matures 
when roberta threatens to reveal her relationship with clyde unless he marries her he plans to murder her by drowning while they go boating having read a local newspaper report of a boating accident 
clyde takes roberta out in a canoe on big moose lake in upstate new york and rows to a secluded bay 
as he speaks to her regarding the end of their relationship roberta moves towards him and he unintentionally strikes her in the face with a camera stunning her and accidentally capsizing the boat 
roberta unable to swim drowns while clyde unwilling to save her swims to shore 
the narrative implies that the blow was accidental but the trail of circumstantial evidence left by the panicky and guilt-ridden clyde points to murder 
the local authorities are eager to convict clyde to the point of manufacturing additional evidence against him although he repeatedly incriminates himself with his confused and contradictory testimony 
clyde has a sensational trial before an unsympathetic and prejudiced jury of mostly religious conservative farmers 
despite a vigorous and untruthful defense by two lawyers hired by his uncle clyde is convicted sentenced to death and after an appeal is denied executed by electric chair 
the jailhouse scenes and correspondence between clyde and his mother are exemplars of pathos in modern literature 
dreiser based the book on a notorious criminal case 
on july NUM NUM resort owners found an overturned boat and the body of grace brown at big moose lake in the adirondack mountains of upstate new york 
chester gillette was put on trial and convicted of killing brown though he claimed that her death was a suicide 
gillette was executed by electric chair on march NUM NUM
the murder trial drew international attention when browns love letters to gillette were read in court 
dreiser saved newspaper clippings about the case for several years before writing his novel during which he studied the case closely 
he based clyde griffiths on chester gillette deliberately giving him the same initials 
a strikingly similar murder took place in wilkes-barre pennsylvania in NUM when robert edwards clubbed freda mckechnie one of his two lovers and placed her body in a lake 
the cases were so similar that the press at the time dubbed the edwardsmckechnie murder the american tragedy
edwards was eventually found guilty and also executed by electric chair 
the novel is a tragedy in the strict sense clydes destruction being the consequence of his innate weaknesses moral and physical cowardice lack of scruple and self-discipline muddled intellect and unfocused ambition additionally the effect of his ingratiating dreiser uses the word soft social manner places temptation in his way which he cannot resist 
this novel is full of symbolism ranging from clydes grotesque description of the high gloomy walls of the factory as an opportunity for success symbolizing how it is all a mirage to the description of girls as electrifying to foreshadow clydes destination to the electric chair dreiser transforms everyday mundane objects to symbols 
dreiser sustains readers interest in the lengthy novel over NUM pages by the accumulation of detail and by continually varying the emotional distance of his writing from clyde and other characters from detailed examination of their thoughts and motivations to dispassionate reportage 
the novel has been adapted several times into other forms and the storyline has been used not always unattributed as the basis for other works


in NUM the book was placed on time magazines list of the top NUM novels written in english since NUM

dismayed with the situation she moved to wyoming where she filed for divorce and landed her first job teaching 
his novel suttree is written with a deep knowledge of revelry and its proponents making it seem semi-autobiographical 
one would think that the author himself is a big drinker but in an interview with richard b woodward from the new york times mccarthy doesnt drink anymore  he quit NUM years ago in el paso with one of his young girlfriends  and suttree reads like a farewell to that life 
the friends i do have are simply those who quit drinking he says

regarding his own literary constraints when writing novels mccarthy said he is not a fan of some of the latin american writers magical realism 
you know its hard enough to get people to believe what youre telling them without making it impossible 
it has to be vaguely plausible 
as reported in wired magazine mccarthys olivetti lettera NUM typewriter which he had owned since buying it in a knoxville pawnshop for NUM in NUM was put up for auction at christies in NUM

the last of the mohicans

the last of the mohicans a narrative of NUM NUM is a historical novel by james fenimore cooper 
it is the second book of the leatherstocking tales pentalogy and the best known to contemporary audiences 
the pathfinder published NUM years later in NUM is its sequel 
the last of the mohicans is set in NUM during the french and indian war the seven years war when france and great britain battled for control of north america 
during this war both the french and the british used native american allies but the french were particularly dependent as they were outnumbered in the northeast frontier areas by the more numerous british colonists 
the novel is set primarily in the upper new york wilderness detailing the transport of the two daughters of colonel munro alice and cora to a safe destination at fort william henry 
among the caravan guarding the women are the frontiersman natty bumppo major duncan heyward and the indians chingachgook and uncas the latter of whom is the novels title character 
these characters are sometimes seen as a microcosm of the budding american society particularly with regard to their racial composition 
the novel has been one of the most popular english-language novels since its publication and is frequently assigned reading in american literature courses 
it has been adapted numerous times and in many languages for films tv movies and cartoons 
at the time of coopers writing many people believed that the native americans were disappearing and would ultimately be assimilated or fail to survive 
especially in the east their numbers continued to decline 
at the same time the author was interested in the period of the frontier of transition when more colonists were increasing pressure on the native americans 
he grew up in cooperstown new york which his father had established on what was then a western frontier of settlement it developed after the revolutionary war 
cooper set this novel during the seven years war an international conflict between great britain and france which had a front in north america known by the anglo-american colonists as the french and indian war 
the conflict arrayed british colonial settlers and minimal regular forces against royal french forces with both sides also relying on native american allies 
the war was fought primarily along the frontiers of the british colonies from virginia to nova scotia 
in the spring of NUM lieutenant colonel george monro became garrison commander of fort william henry located on lake george new york in the province of new york 
in early august major general louis-joseph de montcalm and NUM troops besieged the fort 
on NUM august general webb who commanded the area from his base at fort edward sent NUM regulars and NUM massachusetts militia to reinforce the garrison at william henry 
in the novel this is the relief column with which monros daughters travel 
monro sent messengers south to fort edward on NUM august requesting reinforcements but webb refused to send any of his estimated NUM men north because they were all that stood between the french and albany 
he wrote to munro on NUM august that he should negotiate the best terms possible this communication was intercepted and delivered to montcalm 
in coopers version the missive was being carried by bumppo when he and it fell into french hands 
on NUM august montcalm sent men to the fort under a truce flag to deliver webbs dispatch 
by then the forts walls had been breached many of its guns were useless and the garrison had taken significant casualties 
after another day of bombardment by the french monro raised the white flag and agreed to withdraw under parle 
when the withdrawal began some of montcalms indian allies angered at the lost opportunity for loot attacked the british column 
coopers account of the attack and aftermath is lurid and somewhat inaccurate 
a detailed reconstruction of the action and its aftermath indicates that the final tally of british missing and dead ranges from NUM to NUM more than NUM british were taken captive 
cora and alice munro daughters of lieutenant colonel munro are traveling with major duncan heyward from fort edward to fort william henry where munro is in command and acquire another companion in david gamut a naive singing teacher 
they are guided through the forest by a native named magua who leads them through a shortcut unaccompanied by the british militia 
heyward is dissatisfied with maguas shortcut and the party roam unguided and finally join natty bumppo known as hawk-eye a scout for the british and his two mohican friends chingachgook and his son uncas 
heyward becomes suspicious of magua and hawk-eye and the mohicans agree with his suspicion that magua is a huron scout secretly allied with the french 
upon discovery as such magua escapes and in the correct belief that magua will return with huron reinforcements hawk-eye and the mohicans lead their new companions to a hidden cave on an island in a river 
they are attacked there by the hurons and when ammunition is exhausted hawk-eye and the mohicans escape with a promise to return for their companions 
magua and the hurons capture heyward gamut and the munro sisters and magua admits that he is seeking revenge against coras father colonel munro for turning him into an alcoholic with whiskey causing him to be initially cast out of the hurons and then whipping him at a post for drunken behavior 
he then offers to spare the party if cora becomes his wife but she refuses 
upon a second refusal he sentences the prisoners to death 
hawk-eye and the mohicans rescue all four and lead them to a dilapidated building that was involved with a battle between the indians and the british some years ago 
they are nearly attacked again but the hurons leave the area rather than disturb the graves of their own fellow-countrymen 
the next day hawk-eye leads the party to fort henry past a siege by the french army

according to susan fenimore cooper the authors eldest daughter cooper first conceived the idea for the book while visiting the adirondack mountains in NUM with a party of english gentlemen 
the party passed through the catskills an area with which cooper was already familiar and about which he had written in his first novel featuring natty the pioneers 
they passed on to lake george and glens falls 
impressed with the caves behind the falls one member of the party suggested that here was the very scene for a romance 
susan cooper says that edward smith-stanley NUMth earl of derby made this remark 
cooper promised stanley that a book should actually be written in which these caves should have a place the idea of a romance essentially indian in character then first suggesting itself to his mind 
cooper began work on the novel immediately 
he and his family stayed for the summer in a cottage belonging to a friend situated on the long island shore of the sound opposite blackwells island not far from halletts cove the area is now part of astoria
he wrote quickly and completed the novel in the space of three or four months 
he suffered a serious illness thought to have been brought on by sunstroke and at one point he dictated the outline of the fight between magua and chingachgook NUMth chapter to his wife who thought that he was delirious 
in the novel hawkeye refers to lake george as the horican
cooper felt that lake george was too plain while the french name le lac du st sacrement was too complicated
horican he found on an old map of the area it was a french transliteration of a native group who had once lived in the area 
cooper grew up in cooperstown new york the frontier town founded by his father 
his daughter said that as a young man he had few opportunities to meet and talk with native americans occasionally some small party of the oneidas or other representatives of the five nations had crossed his path in the valley of the susquehanna river or on the shores of lake ontario where he served when a midshipman in the navy 
he read what sources were available at the timeheckewelder charlevoix william penn smith elliot colden lang lewis and clark and mackenzie 
by using the name uncas for one of his characters he seemed to confuse the two regional tribes the mohegan of connecticut of which uncas had been a well-known sachem and the mahican of upstate new york 
the popularity of coopers book helped spread the confusion 
in the period when cooper was writing deputations from the western tribes frequently traveled through the region along the mohawk river on their way to new york or washington dc 
he made a point of visiting these parties as they passed through albany and new york 
on several occasions he followed them all the way to washington to observe them for longer 
he also talked to the military officers and interpreters who accompanied them 
the novel was first published in NUM by carey  lea of philadelphia 
according to susan cooper its success was greater than that of any previous book from the same pen and in europe the book produced quite a startling effect 
coopers novels were popular but reviewers were often critical or dismissive 
for example the reviewer of the london magazine may NUM described the novel as clearly by much the worst of mr coopers performances 
mark twain notably derided the author in his essay fenimore coopers literary offenses published in north american review july NUM
twain complained that cooper lacked a variety of style and was overly wordy 
in the essay twain re-writes a small section of the last of the mohicans claiming that cooper the generous spendthrift used NUM extra and unnecessary words in the original version 
re-reading the book in his later years cooper noted some inconsistencies of plot and characterization particularly the character of munro 
but he wrote that in general the book must needs have some interest for the reader since it could amuse even the writer who had in a great measure forgotten the details of his own work 
the book has been considered to be the first great american novel 
the last of the mohicans has been james fenimore coopers most popular work 
it has continued as one of the most widely read novels throughout the world and it has influenced popular opinion about american indians and the frontier period of eastern american history 
the romanticized images of the strong fearless and ever resourceful frontiersman ie  natty bumppo as well as the stoic wise and noble red man ie  chingachgook were notions derived from coopers characterizations more than from anywhere else 
the phrase the last of the mohicans has come to represent the sole survivor of a noble race or type 
a number of films have been based on the lengthy book making various cuts compressions and changes 
the american adaptations include

the NUM film has been deemed culturally significant by the library of congress and selected for preservation in the united states national film registry 
according to the director michael mann his NUM version was based more on the NUM film version 
mann believes coopers novel is not a very good book taking issue with coopers sympathy for the euro-americans and their seizure of the american indians domain 
in germany der letzte der mohikaner with bla lugosi as chingachgook was the second part of the two-part lederstrumpf film released in NUM
der letzte mohikaner directed by harald reinl was a NUM west germanitalianspanish co-production setting elements of the story in the post american civil war era 
based on the same series of the novels chingachgook die groe schlange chingachgook the great serpent starring gojko mitic as chingachgook appeared in east germany in NUM and became popular throughout the eastern bloc 
in NUM lake george opera presented an opera version the last of the mohicans by composer alva henderson 
classic comics NUM the last of the mohicans first published NUM
marvel comics has published two versions of the story in NUM a one-issue version as part of their marvel classics comics series issue NUM
in NUM they published a six-issue mini-series to start off the new marvel illustrated series 
famed manga artist shigeru sugiura wrote and illustrated a very loose manga adaptation of the story in NUM-NUM remade in NUM-NUM
this adaptation is heavily influenced by american movies and western comics and is filled with absurd humor and anachronistic jokes 
an english translation of sugiuras NUM-NUM version including a lengthy essay on sugiuras artistic influences was published in the united states in NUM
invisible man

invisible man is a novel by ralph ellison about an african-american man whose color renders him invisible published by random house in NUM
it addresses many of the social and intellectual issues facing african americans early in the twentieth century including black nationalism the relationship between black identity and marxism and the reformist racial policies of booker t washington as well as issues of individuality and personal identity 
invisible man won the us national book award for fiction in NUM
in NUM the modern library ranked invisible man NUMth on its list of the NUM best english-language novels of the NUMth century 
time magazine included the novel in its time NUM best english-language novels from NUM to NUM calling it the quintessential american picaresque of the NUMth century rather than a race novel or even a bildungsroman
malcolm bradbury and richard ruland recognize an existential vision with a kafka-like absurdity
according to the new york times former us president barack obama modeled his memoir dreams from my father on ellisons novel 
ellison says in his introduction to the NUMth anniversary edition that he started to write what would eventually become invisible man in a barn in waitsfield vermont in the summer of NUM while on sick leave from the merchant marine 
the book took five years to complete with one year off for what ellison termed an ill-conceived short novel 
invisible man was published as a whole in NUM
ellison had published a section of the book in NUM the famous battle royal scene which had been shown to cyril connolly the editor of horizon magazine by frank taylor one of ellisons early supporters 
in his speech accepting the NUM national book award ellison said that he considered the novels chief significance to be its experimental attitude 
before invisible man many even most novels dealing with african americans were seen and even written solely for social protest 
most notably native son and uncle toms cabin and while ellison dovetailed two movements the harlem renaissance and the black arts movement neither defined his work completely which reinforced his claim to a unique experimental narrative that broke with tradition 
while ellison certainly drew inspiration from the harlem renaissance especially in the characters he wrote about jim trueblood dr bledsoe mary rambo to name a few 
you cant really say that ellison was a classical harlem renaissance writer 
not that it wasnt ingrained in him 
at the federal writers project ellison had previously interviewed many older people who were living examples to the movement 
ellison once quipped that he needs to get real angry and start talking with the old folk again 
a reference to his days at the wpa possibly
at least on some level ellison had an indebtedness to that time period 
examples of this can be read in the way it is collected in shadow and act 
ellison was also not a black arts movement writer 
many of the notable writers of black arts movement were disillusioned with ellison 
john oliver killens denounced invisible man like this the negro people need ralph ellisons invisible man like we need a hole in the head or a stab in the back 



it is a vicious distortion of negro life 
he and amiri baraka were always at odds 
that said ellisons style is uniquely his 
it has some basis in modern symbolism 
in the poem the waste land by t s 
eliot  using one notable example ellison was immediately impressed with its ability to merge his two greatest passions that of music and literature 
when asked later what he had learned from the poem ellison responded imagery and also improvisationtechniques he had only before seen in jazz 
but ellisons influences run deep 
the aforementioned wpa and what he called his literary ancestors ernest hemingway william faulkner mark twain and others along with books such as dostoevskys notes from underground and even as broad-reaching as speculative writers such as kenneth burke all of whom ellison used to break away from classical african-american writing 
ellison biographer arnold rampersad feels that the character of the narrator resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles ishmael of moby-dick.
ellison signals his debt in the prologue to the novel where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service brothers and sisters my text this morning is the blackness of blackness 
and the congregation answers that blackness is most black brother most black .. in this scene ellison reprises a moment in the second chapter of moby-dick where ishmael wanders around new bedford looking for a place to spend the night and enters a black church it was a negro church and the preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there 
according to rampersad it was melville who empowered ellison to insist on a place in the american literary tradition by his example of representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in moby-dick
ellison always believed that he would be a musician first and a writer second and yet even so he had acknowledged that writing provided him a growing satisfaction 
it was a covert process according to ellison a refusal of his right hand to let his left hand know what it was doing 
the letters he wrote to fellow novelist richard wright as he started working on the novel provide evidence for his disillusion and defection with the communist party 
in a letter to wright august NUM NUM ellison poured out his anger toward party leaders for betraying african-american and marxist class politics during the war years 
if they want to play ball with the bourgeoisie they neednt think they can get away with it .. maybe we cant smash the atom but we can with a few well chosen well written words smash all that crummy filth to hell 
in the wake of this disillusion ellison began writing invisible man a novel that was in part his response to the partys betrayal 
the narrator an unnamed black man begins by describing his living conditions an underground room wired with hundreds of electric lights operated by power stolen from the citys electric grid 
he reflects on the various ways in which he has experienced social invisibility during his life and begins to tell his story returning to his teenage years 
the narrator lives in a small southern town and upon graduating from high school wins a scholarship to an all-black college 
however to receive it he must first take part in a brutal humiliating battle royal for the entertainment of the towns rich white dignitaries 
one afternoon during his junior year at the college the narrator chauffeurs mr norton a visiting rich white trustee out among the old slave-quarters beyond the campus 
by chance he stops at the cabin of jim trueblood who has caused a scandal by impregnating both his wife and his daughter in his sleep 
truebloods account horrifies mr norton so badly that he asks the narrator to find him a drink 
the narrator drives him to a bar filled with prostitutes and patients from a nearby mental hospital 
the mental patients rail against both of them and eventually overwhelm the orderly assigned to keep the patients under control 
the narrator hurries an injured mr norton away from the chaotic scene and back to campus 
dr bledsoe the college president excoriates the narrator for showing mr norton the underside of black life beyond the campus and expels him 
however bledsoe gives several sealed letters of recommendation to the narrator to be delivered to friends of the college in order to assist him in finding a job so that he may eventually re-enroll 
the narrator travels to new york and distributes his letters with no success the son of one recipient shows him the letter which reveals bledsoes intent to never admit the narrator as a student again 
acting on the sons suggestion the narrator seeks work at a paint factory renowned for its pure white paint 
he is assigned first to the shipping department then to the boiler room whose chief attendant lucius brockway is highly paranoid and suspects that the narrator is trying to take his job 
this distrust worsens after the narrator stumbles into a union meeting and brockway attacks the narrator and tricks him into setting off an explosion in the boiler room 
the narrator is hospitalized and subjected to shock treatment overhearing the doctors discussion of him as a possible mental patient 
after leaving the hospital the narrator faints on the streets of harlem and is taken in by mary rambo a kindly old-fashioned woman who reminds him of his relatives in the south 
he later happens across the eviction of an elderly black couple and makes an impassioned speech that incites the crowd to attack the law enforcement officials in charge of the proceedings 
the narrator escapes over the rooftops and is confronted by brother jack the leader of a group known as the brotherhood that professes its commitment to bettering conditions in harlem and the rest of the world 
at jacks urging the narrator agrees to join and speak at rallies to spread the word among the black community 
using his new salary he pays mary the back rent he owes her and moves into an apartment provided by the brotherhood 
the rallies go smoothly at first with the narrator receiving extensive indoctrination on the brotherhoods ideology and methods 
soon though he encounters trouble from ras the exhorter a fanatical black nationalist who believes that the brotherhood is controlled by whites 
neither the narrator nor tod clifton a youth leader within the brotherhood is particularly swayed by his words 
the narrator is later called before a meeting of the brotherhood and accused of putting his own ambitions ahead of the group 
he is reassigned to another part of the city to address issues concerning women seduced by the wife of a brotherhood member and eventually called back to harlem when clifton is reported missing and the brotherhoods membership and influence begin to falter 
the narrator can find no trace of clifton at first but soon discovers him selling dancing sambo dolls on the street having become disillusioned with the brotherhood 
clifton is shot and killed by a policeman while resisting arrest at his funeral the narrator delivers a rousing speech that rallies the crowd to support the brotherhood again 
at an emergency meeting jack and the other brotherhood leaders criticize the narrator for his unscientific arguments and the narrator determines that the group has no real interest in the black communitys problems 
the narrator returns to harlem trailed by rass men and buys a hat and a pair of sunglasses to elude them 
as a result he is repeatedly mistaken for a man named rinehart known as a lover a hipster a gambler a briber and a spiritual leader 
understanding that rinehart has adapted to white society at the cost of his own identity the narrator resolves to undermine the brotherhood by feeding them dishonest information concerning the harlem membership and situation 
after seducing the wife of one member in a fruitless attempt to learn their new activities he discovers that riots have broken out in harlem due to widespread unrest 
he realizes that the brotherhood has been counting on such an event in order to further its own aims 
the narrator gets mixed up with a gang of looters who burn down a tenement building and wanders away from them to find ras now on horseback armed with a spear and shield and calling himself the destroyer 
ras shouts for the crowd to lynch the narrator but the narrator attacks him with the spear and escapes into an underground coal bin 
two white men seal him in leaving him alone to ponder the racism he has experienced in his life 
the epilogue returns to the present with the narrator stating that he is ready to return to the world because he has spent enough time hiding from it 
he explains that he has told his story in order to help people see past his own invisibility and also to provide a voice for people with a similar plight who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
critic orville prescott of the new york times called the novel the most impressive work of fiction by an american negro which i have ever read and felt it marked the appearance of a richly talented writer 
novelist saul bellow in his review found it a book of the very first order a superb book ..it is tragi-comic poetic the tone of the very strongest sort of creative intelligence 
george mayberry of the new republic said ellison is a master at catching the shape flavor and sound of the common vagaries of human character and experience 
in the paris review literary critic harold bloom referred to invisible man along with zora neale hurstons their eyes were watching god as the only full scale works of fiction i have read by american blacks in this century that have survival possibilities at all 
it was reported in october NUM that streaming service hulu was developing the novel into a television series 
american pastoral

american pastoral is a philip roth novel published in NUM concerning seymour swede levov a successful jewish american businessman and former high school star athlete from newark new jersey 
levovs happy and conventional upper middle class life is ruined by the domestic social and political turmoil of the NUMs during the presidency of lyndon b johnson which in the novel is described as a manifestation of the indigenous american berserk
the framing device in american pastoral is a NUMth high school reunion attended by frequent roth alter ego nathan zuckerman who is the narrator 
at the reunion in NUM zuckerman meets former classmate jerry levov who describes to him the tragic derailment of the life of his recently deceased older brother seymour swede levov 
after seymours teenage daughter merry in NUM set off a bomb in protest against american involvement in the vietnam war killing a bystander and subsequently went into hiding seymour remained traumatized for the rest of his life 
the rest of the novel consists of zuckermans posthumous recreation of seymours life based on jerrys revelation a few newspaper clippings and zuckermans own impressions after two brief run-ins with the swede in NUM and shortly before seymours death from prostate cancer at age NUM in NUM
in these encounters which take place early in the novel zuckerman learns that seymour has remarried and has three young sons but seymours daughter merry is never mentioned 
in zuckermans reimagining of seymours life this second marriage has no part it ends in NUM with watergate unraveling on tv while the previous lives of the protagonists completely disintegrate 
american pastoral won the pulitzer prize in NUM and was included in times list of the NUM best novels 
the film rights to it were later optioned though a film version was not made until NUM
in NUM it was one of the runners-up to toni morrisons beloved in the what is the best work of american fiction of the last NUM years
contest held by the new york times book review 
seymour irving levov is born and raised in the weequahic section of newark new jersey in NUM as the elder son of a successful jewish american glove manufacturer lou levov and his wife sylvia 
called the swede because of his anomalous blond hair blue eyes and nordic good looks seymour is a star athlete in high school a two-year veteran of the marine corps and the narrator nathan zuckermans idol and hero 
zuckerman and seymours younger brother jerrywho grows into a curmudgeonly irascible heart surgeon with little empathy for the swedeare schoolmates and close friends 
the swede eventually takes over his fathers glove factory and marries dawn dwyer a former beauty queen from nearby elizabeth whom he met in college 
seymour establishes what he believes to be a perfect american life with a beloved wife and daughter a satisfying business career and a magnificent house in the idyllic hamlet of old rimrock 
yet as the vietnam war and racial unrest rack the country and destroy inner-city newark his precocious teenage daughter meredith merry beset by an emotionally debilitating stutter and outraged by the war becomes increasingly radical in her beliefs 
in february NUM merry plants a bomb in the old rimrock post office which kills a bystander she goes into permanent hiding 
seymour finds merry five years later living in deplorable conditions in inner-city newark 
during this reunion merry reveals that she was responsible for several more bombings killing three more people 
though merry informs him that her actions were deliberate seymour decides to keep their meeting a secret believing merry has been manipulated by an unknown political group and a mysterious woman named rita cohen 
at a dinner party seymour discovers that his wife dawn has been having an affair with princeton-educated architect william orcutt iii for whom she undergoes a facelift 
seymour then realizes that his wife is planning to leave him for orcutt 
it is revealed that seymour himself previously had a short-term affair with merrys speech therapist sheila salzman and that she and her husband shelly hid merry in their home after the post office bombing 
seymour sadly concludes that everyone he knows may have a veneer of respectability but each engages in subversive behavior and that he cannot understand the truth about anyone based upon the conduct they outwardly display 
he is forced to see the truth about the chaos and discord rumbling beneath the american pastoral which has brought about profound personal and societal changes he no longer can ignore 
simultaneously the dinner party underscores the fact that no one ever truly understands the hearts of other people 
the novel alludes extensively to the social upheavals of the late NUMs and early NUMs 
it refers to the NUM newark riots the watergate scandal the sexual revolution and deep throat the code name of the secret source in the watergate scandal and the title of a NUM pornographic film 
in the novels final scene both the watergate scandal and the pornographic film are discussed at a dinner party during which the first marriage of the swede begins to unravel when he discovers that his wife is having an affair 
the novel also alludes to the rhetoric of revolutionary violence of the radical fringe of the new left and the black panthers the trial of the leftist african-american activist angela davis and the bombings carried out between NUM and NUM by the weathermen and other radicals opposing the us military intervention in vietnam 
the novel quotes from frantz fanons a dying colonialism which zuckerman imagines as one of the texts that inspires merry to carry out her bombing of a local post office 
in the novel merrys bombing takes place in february NUM during the presidency of lyndon b johnson after which she flees her parental home 
by that time she has had a weathermen motto tacked up in her room for many months 
in reality this would have been impossible 
the weathermen group was in fact formed in the summer of NUM
the lines of the motto which appear in the novel we are against everything that is good and decent in honky america 
we will loot and burn and destroy 
we are the incubation of your mothers nightmares 
allude to a speech by john jacobs at a weathermen war council in december NUM
the inspiration for the levov character was a real person seymour swede masin a legendary all-around jewish athlete who like the levov character attended newarks weequahic high school 
like the books protagonist swede masin was revered and idolized by many local middle-class jews 
both swedes were tall and had distinctively blond hair and blue eyes which stood out among the typically dark-haired dark-complexioned local residents 
both attended a teachers college in nearby east orange both married out of their faith both served in the military and upon their return both moved to the suburbs of newark 
ewan mcgregor directed and starred in the film along with jennifer connelly and dakota fanning 
filming began in pittsburgh pennsylvania in september NUM and the film premiered at the toronto international film festival in september NUM
the american scholar

the american scholar was a speech given by ralph waldo emerson on august NUM NUM to the phi beta kappa society of harvard college at the first parish in cambridge in cambridge massachusetts 
he was invited to speak in recognition of his groundbreaking work nature published a year earlier in which he established a new way for americas fledgling society to regard the world 
sixty years after declaring independence american culture was still heavily influenced by europe and emerson for possibly the first time in the countrys history provided a visionary philosophical framework for escaping from under its iron lids and building a new distinctly american cultural identity 
emerson introduces transcendentalist and romantic views to explain an american scholars relationship to nature 
a few key points he makes include

emerson was in part reflecting on his personal vocational crisis after leaving his role as a minister 
oliver wendell holmes sr declared this speech to be americas intellectual declaration of independence 
building on the growing attention he received from the essay nature the american scholar solidified emersons popularity and weight in america a level of reverence he would hold throughout the rest of his life 
phi beta kappas literary quarterly magazine the american scholar was named after the speech 
this success stands in contrast with the harsh reaction to another of his speeches divinity school address given eleven months later

these characters cross between the major narrative threads


infinite jest is a postmodern encyclopedic novel famous for its length and detail and for its digressions that involve endnotes some of which themselves have footnotes
it has also been called metamodernist and hysterical realist 
wallaces encyclopedic display of knowledge incorporates media theory linguistics film studies sport addiction science and issues of national identity 
the book is often humorous yet explores melancholy deeply 
eschewing chronological plot development and straightforward resolutiona concern often mentioned in reviewsthe novel supports a wide range of readings 
at various times wallace said that he intended for the novels plot to resolve but indirectly responding to his editors concerns about the lack of resolution he said the answers all exist but just past the last page
long after publication wallace maintained this position stating that the novel does resolve but it resolves .. outside of the right frame of the picture 
you can get a pretty good idea i think of what happens
critical reviews and a readers guide have provided insight but burns notes that wallace privately conceded to jonathan franzen that the story cant fully be made sense of
in an interview with charlie rose wallace characterized the novels heavy use of endnotes as a method of disrupting the linearity of the text while maintaining some sense of narrative cohesion 
the novel touches on many topics including addiction to drugs but also to sex and fame withdrawal recovery death family relationships absent or dead parents mental health suicide sadness entertainment film theory media theory linguistics science quebec separatism national identity and tennis as a metaphysical activity 
infinite jest draws explicitly or allusively on many previous works of literature 
as its title implies the novel is in part based on the play hamlet
enfield tennis academy corresponds to denmark ruled by james king hamlet and avril queen gertrude
when james dies he is replaced by charles claudius the uncle of avrils gifted son hal prince hamlet
as in the play the sons task is to fight incipient mental breakdown in order to redeem his fathers reputation 
another link is to the odyssey wherein the son telemachus hal has to grow apart from his dominating mother penelope avril and discover the truth about his absent father odysseus james
that pattern is also reproduced in the novel ulysses set in a realistic version of dublin populated by a wide range of inhabitants just as infinite jest is mostly in a realistic boston with a varied population 
in one scene hal on the phone with orin says that clipping his toenails into a wastebasket now seems like an exercise in telemachry 
orin then asks whether hal meant telemetry 
christopher bartlett has argued that hals mistake is a direct reference to telemachus who for the first four books of the odyssey believes that his father is dead 
links to the brothers karamazov have been analyzed by timothy jacobs who sees orin representing the nihilistic dmitri hal standing for ivan and mario the simple and good alyosha 
the film so entertaining that its viewers lose interest in anything else has been likened to the monty python sketch the funniest joke in the world as well as to the experience machine a thought experiment by robert nozick 
infinite jest was marketed heavily and wallace had to adapt to being a public figure 
he was interviewed in national magazines and went on a NUM-city book tour 
publisher little brown equated the books heft with its importance in marketing and sent a series of cryptic teaser postcards to NUM people announcing a novel of infinite pleasure and infinite style
rolling stone sent reporter david lipsky to follow wallace on his triumphant book tourthe first time the magazine had sent a reporter to profile a young author in ten years 
the interview was never published in the magazine but became lipskys new york times-bestselling book although of course you end up becoming yourself NUM of which the NUM movie the end of the tour is an adaptation 
early reviews contributed to infinite jests hype many of them describing it as a momentous literary event 
in the review of contemporary fiction steven moore called the book a profound study of the postmodern condition 
in NUM chad harbach declared that in retrospect infinite jest now looks like the central american novel of the past thirty years a dense star for lesser work to orbit 
in a NUM retrospective by the new york times it was described as a masterpiece thats also a monsternearly NUM pages of mind-blowing inventiveness and disarming sweetness 
its size and complexity make it forbidding and esoteric 
time magazine included the novel in its list of the NUM best english-language novels published between NUM and NUM
as wallaces magnum opus infinite jest is at the center of the new discipline of wallace studies which according to the chronicle of higher education ... is on its way to becoming a robust scholarly enterprise 
not all critics were as laudatory 
some early reviews such as michiko kakutanis in the new york times were mixed recognizing the inventiveness of the writing but criticizing the length and plot 
she called the novel a vast encyclopedic compendium of whatever seems to have crossed wallaces mind 
in the london review of books dale peck wrote of the novel ... it is in a word terrible 
other words i might use include bloated boring gratuitous andperhaps especiallyuncontrolled 
harold bloom sterling professor of humanities at yale university called it just awful and written with no discernible talent in the novel blooms own work is called turgid
and in a review of wallaces work up to the year NUM ao 
scott wrote of infinite jest the novels pynchonesque elements ..feel rather willed and secondhand 
they are impressive in the manner of a precocious childs performance at a dinner party and in the same way ultimately irritating they seem motivated mostly by a desire to show off 
some critics have since qualified their initial stances 
in NUM scott called infinite jest an enormous zeitgeist-gobbling novel that set his generations benchmark for literary ambition and wallace the best mind of his generation 
james wood has said that he regrets his negative review i wish id slowed down a bit more with david foster wallace 
and in NUM kakutani wrote in the new york times todays literary landscape of course is exponentially richer more variegated and more complexin no small part because of wallaces influence on contemporaries and younger writers 
infinite jest has been translated into
great american novel

the idea of the great american novel is the concept of a novel of high literary merit which shows the culture of the united states at a specific time in the countrys history 
the novel is presumably written by an american author who is knowledgeable about the state culture and perspective of the common american citizen 
the author uses the literary work to identify and exhibit the language used by the american people of the time and to capture the unique american experience especially as it is perceived for the time 
in historical terms it is sometimes equated as being the american response to the national epic 
while fiction was written in colonial america as early as the NUMth century it was not until a distinct american identity developed in the NUMth century that works classified as american literature began 
americas identity as a nation was reflected alongside the development of its literature 
the term great american novel derives directly from the title of an NUM essay by american civil war novelist john william de forest 
in modern usage the term is often figurative and represents a canonical writing making it a literary benchmark emblematic of what defines american literature in a given era 
aspiring writers of all ages but especially students are often said to be driven to write the great american novel 
theoretically such a work would be the greatest american book on american culture which could ever be written 
thus great american novel is a metaphor for identity a platonic ideal that is not achieved in any specific texts but whose aim writers strive to mirror in their work 
at one time the following works have been considered to be a great american novel
national epic

a national epic is an epic poem or a literary work of epic scope which seeks or is believed to capture and express the essence or spirit of a particular nation not necessarily a nation state but at least an ethnic or linguistic group with aspirations to independence or autonomy 
national epics frequently recount the origin of a nation a part of its history or a crucial event in the development of national identity such as other national symbols 
in a broader sense a national epic may simply be an epic in the national language which the people or government of that nation are particularly proud of 
it is distinct from a pan-national epic which is taken as representative of a larger cultural or linguistic group than a nation or a nation-state 
in medieval times homers iliad was taken to be based on historical facts and the trojan war came to be considered as seminal in the genealogies of european monarchies 
virgils aeneid was taken to be the roman equivalent of the iliad starting from the fall of troy and leading up to the birth of the young roman nation 
according to the then prevailing conception of history empires were born and died in organic succession and correspondences existed between the past and the present 
geoffrey of monmouths NUMth century classically inspired historia regum britanniae for example fulfilled this function for the british or welsh 
just as kings longed to emulate great leaders of the past alexander or caesar it was a temptation for poets to become a new homer or virgil 
in NUMth century portugal luis de cames celebrated portugal as a naval power in his os lusadas while pierre de ronsard set out to write la franciade an epic meant to be the gallic equivalent of virgils poem that also traced back frances ancestry to trojan princes 
the emergence of a national ethos however preceded the coining of the phrase national epic which seems to originate with romantic nationalism 
where no obvious national epic existed the romantic spirit was motivated to fill it 
an early example of poetry that was invented to fill a perceived gap in national myth is ossian the narrator and supposed author of a cycle of poems by james macpherson which macpherson claimed to have translated from ancient sources in scottish gaelic 
however many national epics including macphersons ossian antedate NUMth-century romanticism 
in the early NUMth century the phrase no longer necessarily applies to an epic poem and occurs to describe a literary work that readers and critics agree is emblematical of the literature of a nation without necessarily including details from that nations historical background 
in this context the phrase has definitely positive connotations as for example in james joyces ulysses where it is suggested don quixote is spains national epic while irelands remains as yet unwritten they remind one of don quixote and sancho panza 
our national epic has yet to be written dr sigerson says 
moore is the man for it 
a knight of the rueful countenance here in dublin.br

examples of epics that have been enlisted as national include






some prose works while not strictly epic poetry have an important place in the national consciousness of their nations 
these include the following
beloved novel

beloved is a NUM novel by the american writer toni morrison 
set after the american civil war NUM it is inspired by the story of an african-american slave margaret garner who escaped slavery in kentucky late january NUM by fleeing to ohio a free state 
morrison had come across the story a visit to the slave mother who killed her child in an NUM newspaper article published in the american advocate and reproduced in the black book a miscellaneous compilation of black history and culture that morrison edited in NUM
beloved begins in NUM in cincinnati ohio where the protagonist sethe a former slave has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter denver 
sethes mother-in-law baby suggs lived with them until her death eight years earlier 
just before baby suggs death sethes two sons howard and buglar ran away 
sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence of an abusive ghost that haunted their house at NUM bluestone road for years 
the story opens with an introduction to the ghost NUM was spiteful 
full of a babys venom 
the novel won the pulitzer prize for fiction in NUM and was a finalist for the NUM national book award 
it was adapted during NUM into a movie of the same name starring oprah winfrey 
a new york times survey of writers and literary critics ranked it the best work of american fiction from NUM to NUM
the books dedication reads sixty million and more referring to the africans and their descendants who died as a result of the atlantic slave trade 
the books epigraph is romans NUM
the book is the story of sethe and her daughter denver after their escape from slavery 
their home in cincinnati is haunted by a revenant whom they believe to be the ghost of sethes daughter 
because of the hauntingwhich often involves objects being thrown around the roomsethes youngest daughter denver is shy friendless and housebound and her sons howard and buglar have run away from home by the age of NUM
baby suggs the mother of sethes husband halle dies in her bed soon afterwards 
paul d one of the slaves from sweet homethe plantation where baby suggs sethe halle and several other slaves once workedarrives at sethes home and tries to bring a sense of reality into the house 
in attempting to make the family forget the past he forces out the spirit 
he seems successful at first he even brings housebound denver out of the house for the first time in years 
but on the way back they encounter a young woman sitting in front of the house calling herself beloved 
paul d is suspicious and warns sethe but she is charmed by the young woman and ignores him 
gradually paul d is forced out of sethes home by a supernatural presence 
when made to sleep outside in a shed paul d is cornered by beloved 
while they have sex his mind is filled with horrific memories from his past 
overwhelmed with guilt paul d tries to tell sethe about it but cannot and instead says he wants her pregnant 
sethe is elated and paul d resists beloved and her influence over him 
but when he tells friends at work about his plans to start a new family they react fearfully 
stamp paid reveals the reason for the communitys rejection of sethe 
when paul d asks sethe about it she tells him what happened after escaping from sweet home and reaching her waiting children at her mother-in-laws home sethe was found by her master who attempted to reclaim her and her children 
sethe grabbed her children ran into the tool shed and tried to kill them all 
she succeeded only in killing her eldest daughter then two years old by running a saw along her neck 
sethe claims that she was trying to put my babies where they would be safe 
the revelation is too much for paul d and he leaves 
without him sense of reality and time moving forward disappears 
sethe comes to believe that beloved is the two-year-old daughter she murdered whose tombstone reads only beloved
sethe begins to spend carelessly and spoil beloved out of guilt 
beloved becomes angry and more demanding throwing tantrums when she doesnt get her way 
beloveds presence consumes sethes life to the point where she becomes depleted and sacrifices her own need for eating while beloved grows bigger and bigger 
in the novels climax youngest daughter denver reaches out and searches for help from the black community and some of the village women arrive at the house to exorcise beloved 
at the same time a white man comes into view the same man that helped halles mother baby suggs by offering her the house as a place to stay after halle bought her from their owner 
he has come for denver who asked him for a job but denver has not shared this information with sethe 
unaware of the situation sethe attacks the white man with an ice pick and is brought down by the village women 
while sethe is confused and has a re-memory of her master coming again beloved disappears 
the novel resolves with denver becoming a working member of the community and paul d returning to sethe and pledging his love 
the maternal bonds between sethe and her children inhibit her own individuation and prevent the development of her self 
sethe develops a dangerous maternal passion that results in the murder of one daughter her own best self and the estrangement of the surviving daughter from the black community both in an attempt to salvage her fantasy of the future her children from a life in slavery 
however sethe fails to recognize her daughter denvers need for interaction with this community in order to enter into womanhood 
denver finally succeeds at the end of the novel in establishing her own self and embarking on her individuation with the help of beloved 
contrary to denver sethe only becomes individuated after beloveds exorcism at which point sethe can fully accept the first relationship that is completely for her her relationship with paul d this relationship relieves sethe from the ensuing destruction of herself that resulted from the maternal bonds controlling her life 
beloved and sethe are both very much emotionally impaired as a result of sethes previous enslavement 
slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child which has devastating consequences for both parties 
furthermore the earliest need a child has is related to the mother the baby needs milk from the mother 
sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen because it means she cannot form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter 
because of the experiences of slavery most slaves repressed these memories in an attempt to forget the past 
this repression and dissociation from the past causes a fragmentation of the self and a loss of true identity 
sethe paul d and denver all experience this loss of self which could only be remedied by the acceptance of the past and the memory of their original identities 
beloved serves to remind these characters of their repressed memories eventually causing the reintegration of their selves 
slavery splits a person into a fragmented figure 
the identity consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past denied and kept at bay becomes a self that is no self 
to heal and humanize one must constitute it in a language reorganize the painful events and retell the painful memories 
as a result of suffering the self becomes subject to a violent practice of making and unmaking once acknowledged by an audience becomes real 
sethe paul d and baby suggs who all fall short of such realization are unable to remake their selves by trying to keep their pasts at bay 
the self is located in a word defined by others 
the power lies in the audience or more precisely in the word  once the word changes so does the identity 
all of the characters in beloved face the challenge of an unmade self composed of their rememories and defined by perceptions and language 
the barrier that keeps them from remaking of the self is the desire for an uncomplicated past and the fear that remembering will lead them to a place they couldnt get back from 
the discussion of manhood and masculinity is foreshadowed by the dominant meaning of sethes story 
beloved depicts slavery in two main emotions love and self-preservation however morrison does more than depict emotions 
the author dramatizes paul ds enslavement to speak of his morals of manhood 
in fact it also distorts him from himself 
morrison expanded on this idea indirectly by revealing different pathways to the meaning of manhood by her stylistic devices 
she established new information for understanding the legacy of slavery best depicted through stylistic devices 
to understand paul ds story on manhood morrison puts his half- formed words and thoughts to give the audience a taste of what is going on inside his mind 
throughout the novel paul ds depiction of manhood was being challenged by the values of the white culture 
the author demonstrates the distinctions between western and african values and how the dialogue between the two values is heard through juxtaposition and allusions 
she had to maneuver her message though the social atmosphere of her words 
she did this by characters motives and actions acquire 
paul ds is a victim of racial inferiority in that his dreams and goals are so high that he will never be able to achieve them because of the color of his skin 
however paul d does not see color he sees himself as the same status as his white counterparts even though during this time that was never possible 
he thought he earned his right to reach each of his goals because of his sacrifices and what he has been through previously in that society will pay him back and allow him to do what his heart desired 
during the reconstruction era jim crow laws were put in place to limit the movement and involvement of african-americans in the white-dominant society 
black men during this time had to establish their own identity which may seem impossible due to all the limitations put upon them 
many black men like paul d struggled to find their meaning in their society and achieving their goals because of the disabilities that constrained them to a certain part of the social hierarchy 
in beloved sethe observes paul d sitting on the base of the church steps  liquor bottle in hand stripped of the very maleness that enables him to caress and love the wounded sethe NUM
throughout the novel paul d is sitting on a base of some sort or a foundation like a tree stub or the steps for instance 
this exemplifies his place in society 
black men are the foundation of society because without their hard labor the white men would not profit 
they were coerced into the society where they were deemed lower-status because of the color of their skin 
in the novel sethes first child beloved who was murdered by the hands of her mother haunts her 
for example sethe denver and paul d go to the neighborhood carnival which happens to be sethes first social outing since killing her daughter 
when they return home that is when beloved appears at the house 
throughout the novel sethe believes that the person claiming to be beloved is her daughter that she killed NUM years prior 
family relationships is an instrumental element of beloved 
these family relationships help visualize the stress and the dismantlement of african-american families in this era 
the slavery system did not allow african-americans to have rights to themselves to their family belongings and even their children 
so sethe killing beloved was deemed a peaceful act because sethe believed that killing her daughter was saving them 
and by doing this their family is divided and fragmented much like the time they were living in 
after the emancipation proclamation was signed ex-slaves families were broken and bruised because of the hardships they faced as slaves 
since slaves could not participate in societal events they put their faith and trust in the supernatural 
they did rituals and pray to their god and most of them believed in a god or multiple 
in the novel sethes first child beloved who was murdered by the hands of her mother haunts her 
for example sethe denver and paul d go to the neighborhood carnival which happens to be sethes first social outing since killing her daughter 
when they return home that is when beloved appears at the house 
throughout the novel sethe believes that the person claiming to be beloved is her daughter that she killed NUM years prior 
the pain throughout this novel is universal because everyone involved in slavery was heavily scarred whether that be physically mentally sociologically or psychologically 
some of the characters tend to romanticize their pain in a way that each experience is a turning point in ones life 
this concept is played throughout history in early christian contemplative tradition and african american blues tradition 
beloved is a book of the systematic torture that ex-slaves had to deal with after the emancipation proclamation 
therefore in this novel the narrative is like a complex labyrinth because all the characters have been stripped away from their voice their narrative their language in a way that their sense of self is diminished 
also all the characters have had different experiences with slavery which is why their stories and their narrative are distinct from each other 
in addition to the pain many major characters try to beautify pain in a way that diminishes what was done 
for example sethe keeps repeating what a white girl said about her scars on her back calling them a choke-cherry tree 
trunk branches and even leaves NUM
she repeats this to everyone suggesting she is trying to find the beauty in her scar even when they caused her extreme pain 
paul d and baby suggs both look away in disgust and deny that description of sethes scars 
also sethe does the same thing with beloved 
the memory of her ghost-like daughter plays a role of memory grief and spite that separates sethe and her late daughter 
for instance beloved stays in the house with paul d and sethe 
a home is a place of vulnerability where the heart lies 
paul d and baby suggs both suggest that beloved is not invited into the home but sethe says otherwise because she sees beloved all grown and alive instead of the pain of when sethe murdered her 
sethe is the protagonist of the novel 
she is a freed slave from a plantation called sweet home 
she lives in the house named NUM a house on NUM bluestone rd 
but referred to only as NUM which is believed to be haunted because she killed her infant child 
her two sons have fled because of the haunting and she resides in the house with her daughter denver 
she is motherly and will do anything to protect her children from suffering the same abuses she had as a slave 
sethe is greatly influenced by her repression of the trauma she endured she lives with a tree on her back scars from being whipped 
her character is resilient yet defined by her traumatic past 
the opaque understanding of beloved is central to the novel 
she is a young woman who mysteriously appears from a body of water near sethes house and is discovered soaking wet on the doorstep by sethe paul d and denver on their return from visiting the fair they take her in 
it is widely believed that she is the murdered baby who haunted NUM as the haunting ends when she arrives and in many ways she behaves like a child 
the murdered baby was unnamed her name is derived from the engraving on sethes murdered babys tombstone which simply read beloved because sethe could not afford to engrave the word dearly or anything else 
beloved becomes a catalyst to bring repressed trauma of the family to the surface but also creates madness in the house and slowly depletes sethe 
paul d retains his slave name 
all the male slaves at sweet home were named paul yet he also retains many painful memories of his time as a slave and being forced to live in a chain gang 
it is said that his heart is kept in a tobacco tin as he continuously represses his painful memories 
many years after their time together at sweet home paul d and sethe reunite and begin a romantic relationship 
denver is the only child of sethe who is truly present in the novel 
she is isolated by other young girls in the community because they fear the haunting of her house 
over the course of the novel denver fights for her personal independence 
baby suggs is the elderly mother of halle 
halle works to buy her freedom after which she travels to cincinnati and establishes herself as a respected leader in the community 
she lived in NUM where the majority of the novel takes place in the present time 
after sethes act of infanticide baby suggs retires to her death bed where she develops an obsession with colors and sethe inherits the house after her death 
halle is the son of baby suggs the husband of sethe and father of her children 
he and sethe were married in sweet home yet they got separated during her escape 
he is not in the present of the novel but is mentioned in flashbacks 
paul d was the last to see halle churning butter at sweet home 
it is presumed he went mad after seeing residents of sweet home violating sethe and raping her of her breast milk 
schoolteacher is the primary discipliner of the slaves in sweet home 
his name is intentionally not capitalized throughout the novel 
he is the most violent and abusive to the slaves at sweet home and eventually comes after sethe following her escape but is unsuccessful in his attempt to recapture her and her children 
amy denver is a compassionate young white girl who finds sethe desperately trying to make her way to safety after her escape from sweet home 
sethe is extremely pregnant at the time and her feet are bleeding badly from the travel 
amy saves sethes life nurturing her back to health 
later amy delivers sethes daughter on a small boat and sethe names the child denver after her 
in NUM the novel was made into a film directed by jonathan demme and produced by and starring oprah winfrey 
in january NUM beloved was broadcast in NUM episodes by bbc radio NUM as part of its NUM minute drama programme 
the radio series was adapted by patricia cumper 
beloved received the frederic g melcher book award which is named for an editor of publishers weekly
in accepting the award on october NUM NUM morrison said that there is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby honoring the memory of the human beings forced into slavery and brought to the united states 
theres no small bench by the road she continued 
and because such a place doesnt exist that i know of the book had to 
inspired by her remarks the toni morrison society began to install benches at significant sites in the history of slavery in america 
the new york times reported that the first bench by the road was dedicated on july NUM NUM on sullivans island south carolina the place of entry for some NUM percent of the enslaved africans brought to the united states 
morrison said she was extremely moved by the memorial 
in NUM the NUMst bench was placed at the library of congress 
it is dedicated to daniel alexander payne murray NUM the first african-american assistant librarian of congress 
the novel received the seventh annual robert f kennedy center for justice and human rights book award in NUM given to a novelist who most faithfully and forcefully reflects robert kennedys purposes - his concern for the poor and the powerless his struggle for honest and even-handed justice his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity 
the publication of beloved in NUM resulted in the greatest acclaim yet for morrison 
although nominated for the national book award it did not win and NUM african-american writers and critics  including maya angelou amiri baraka jayne cortez angela davis ernest j gaines henry louis gates jr  rosa guy june jordan paule marshall louise meriwether eugene redmond sonia sanchez quincy troupe john edgar wideman and john a williams  signed a letter of protest that was published in the new york times book review on january NUM NUM
yet later in NUM beloved did receive the pulitzer prize for fiction as well as the robert f kennedy memorial book award the melcher book award the lyndhurst foundation award and the elmer holmes bobst award 
despite its popularity and status as one of morrisons most accomplished novels beloved has never been universally hailed as a success 
some reviewers have excoriated the novel for what they consider its excessive sentimentality and sensationalistic depiction of the horrors of slavery including its characterization of the slave trade as a holocaust-like genocide 
others while concurring that beloved is at times overwritten have lauded the novel as a profound and extraordinary act of imagination 
noting the works mythic dimensions and political focus these commentators have treated the novel as an exploration of family trauma and the repression of memory as well as an attempt to restore the historical record and give voice to the collective memory of african americans 
indeed critics and morrison herself have indicated that the controversial epigraph to beloved sixty million and more is drawn from a number of studies on the african slave trade which estimate that approximately half of each ships cargo perished in transit to america 
scholars have additionally debated the nature of the character beloved arguing whether she is actually a ghost or a real person 
numerous reviews assuming beloved to be a supernatural incarnation of sethes daughter have subsequently faulted beloved as an unconvincing and confusing ghost story 
elizabeth b 
house however has argued that beloved is not a ghost and the novel is actually a story of two probable instances of mistaken identity 
beloved is haunted by the loss of her african parents and thus comes to believe that sethe is her mother 
sethe longs for her dead daughter and is rather easily convinced that beloved is the child she has lost 
such an interpretation house contends clears up many puzzling aspects of the novel and emphasizes morrisons concern with familial ties 
since the late NUMs there has been a strong focus on morrisons representation of african-american experience and history 
the idea that writing acts as a means of healing or recovery is a strain in many of these studies 
timothy powell for instance argues that morrisons recovery of a black logos rewrites blackness as affirmation presence and good while theodore o mason jr  suggests that morrisons stories unite communities 
many critics explore memory or what beloveds sethe calls rememory in this light 
susan bowers places morrison in a long tradition of african american apocalyptic writing that looks back in time unveiling the horrors of the past in order to transform them 
several critics have interpreted morrisons representations of trauma and memory through a psychoanalytic framework 
ashraf h a rushdy explores how primal scenes in morrisons novels are an opportunity and affective agency for self-discovery through memory and rememory
as jill matus argues however morrisons representations of trauma are never simply curative in raising the ghosts of the past in order to banish or memorialize them the texts potentially provoke readers to the vicarious experience of trauma and act as a means of transmission
ann snitows reaction to beloved neatly illustrates how morrison criticism began to evolve and move toward new modes of interpretation 
in her NUM review of beloved snitow argues that beloved the ghost at the center of the narrative is too light and hollow rendering the entire novel airless
snitow changed her position after reading criticism that interpreted beloved in a different way seeing something more complicated and burdened than a literal ghost something requiring different forms of creative expression and critical interpretation 
the conflicts at work here are ideological as well as critical they concern the definition and evaluation of american and african-american literature the relationship between art and politics and the tension between recognition and appropriation 
in defining morrisons texts as african-american literature critics have become more attentive to historical and social context and to the way morrisons fiction engages with specific places and moments in time 
as jennings observes many of morrisons novels are set in isolated black communities where african practices and belief systems are not marginalized by a dominant white culture but rather remain active if perhaps subconscious forces shaping the community 
matus comments that morrisons later novels have been even more thoroughly focused on specific historical moments through their engagement with the history of slavery and early twentieth-century harlem they have imagined and memorialized aspects of black history that have been forgotten or inadequately remembered

blood meridian

blood meridian or the evening redness in the west is a NUM epic western or anti-western novel by american author cormac mccarthy 
mccarthys fifth book it was published by random house 
the majority of the story follows a teenager referred to only as the kid with the bulk of the text devoted to his experiences with the glanton gang a historical group of scalp hunters who massacred native americans and others in the united statesmexico borderlands from NUM to NUM for bounty pleasure and eventually out of nihilistic habit 
the role of antagonist is gradually filled by judge holden a physically massive highly-educated exceptionally multi-talented member of the gang depicted as completely bald from head to toe 
although the novel initially generated only lukewarm critical and commercial reception it has since become highly acclaimed and is widely recognized as mccarthys masterpiece as well as one of the greatest american novels of all time 
time magazine included the novel in its time NUM best english-language novels from NUM to NUM
mccarthy wrote blood meridian while living on the money from his NUM macarthur fellows grant 
it is his first novel set in the southwestern united states a change from the appalachian settings of his earlier work 
in his essay for the slate book review from NUM october NUM entitled cormac mccarthy cuts to the bone noah shannon summarizes the existing library archives of the first drafts of the novel as dating to the mid-NUMs 
the review includes digital archive images of several of mccarthys own type-script pages for early versions of the novel 
describing events of extreme violence mccarthys prose is sparse yet expansive with an often biblical quality and frequent religious references 
mccarthys writing style involves many unusual or archaic words no quotation marks for dialogue and no apostrophes to signal most contractions 
mccarthy conducted considerable research to write the book 
critics have repeatedly demonstrated that even brief and seemingly inconsequential passages of blood meridian rely on historical evidence 
the glanton gang segments are based on samuel chamberlains account of the group in his memoir my confession the recollections of a rogue which he wrote during the latter part of his life 
chamberlain rode with john joel glanton and his company between NUM and NUM
the novels antagonist judge holden appeared in chamberlains account but his true identity remains a mystery 
chamberlain does not appear in the novel 
the novel follows an adolescent runaway from tennessee with a predilection for violence known only as the kid who is introduced as being born during the famous leonids meteor shower of NUM
in the late NUMs he first encounters an enormous and completely hairless character judge holden at a religious revival in nacogdoches texas 
there holden shows his dark nature by falsely accusing a preacher of raping both a young girl and a goat inciting those attending the revival to physically attack the preacher 
the kid carries on journeying alone on his mule through the plains of eastern texas and he spends a night in the shelter of a recluse before arriving in bexar
after a violent encounter with a bartender which establishes the kid as a formidable fighter he joins a party of ill-armed united states army irregulars led by a captain white on a filibustering mission to claim mexican land for the united states 
shortly after entering mexico they are attacked and many killed by a band of comanche warriors 
arrested in chihuahua the kid is set free when his cell neighbor and prior acquaintance from texas the earless louis toadvine tells the authorities that the two of them would make useful recruits for the states newly-hired scalp hunting operation led by john joel glanton 
toadvine and the kid consequently join glantons gang 
the bulk of the novel details the gangs conversations and depraved murderous activities as they travel on horseback throughout the borderlands 
the gang encounters a traveling carnival and in untranslated spanish each of their fortunes is told with tarot cards 
the gang originally contracts with various regional leaders to exterminate apaches and are given a bounty for each scalp they recover 
before long however they murder almost anything in their path including peaceful agrarian indians unprotected mexican villagers and even mexican and american soldiers 
judge holden who re-enters the story as a fellow scalp hunter in the glanton gang is presented as a profoundly mysterious and awe-inspiring figure the others seem to regard him as not quite human 
despite his refined manner and remarkable intellect the judge often proves to be among the most ruthless and bloodthirsty members of the gang and is strongly implied to prey on children during their travels 
according to an ex-priest gang member named ben tobin the glanton gang first met the judge while fleeing from the onslaught of a much larger group of apaches 
in the middle of the desert the gang found holden sitting on an enormous boulder where he seemed to be waiting for them all 
he took them to an extinct volcano and improvised gunpowder from natural materials enough to give them the advantage against their apache pursuers 
when the kid remembers seeing holden in nacogdoches tobin explains that each man in the gang claims to have met the judge at some point before joining glantons gang 
after months of marauding the gang crosses into the mexican cession where they set up a systematic and brutal robbery operation at a ferry on the colorado river near yuma arizona 
local yuma quechan indians are approached to help the gang wrest control of the ferry from its original owner but glantons gang betrays the natives using their presence and previously coordinated attack on the ferry as an excuse to seize the ferrys munitions and slaughter the yuma 
because of the new operators brutal ways a group of us army soldiers sets up a second ferry at a ford upriver to crosswhich the yuma briefly appropriate until their ferryman is decapitated and thrown in the river 
eventually after the gang had amassed a large fortune through robbing settlers using the ferry the yumas suddenly attack the gang and kill most of them including glanton though holden after fighting off the yumas using his immense strength to level a howitzer by hand survives and escapes 
the kid toadvine and tobin are among the few other survivors who escape into the desert although the kid takes an arrow in the leg 
heading west together the kid and tobin encounter a weaponless and hatless judge holden and his accompanying imbecile arriving at a watering-hole 
the judge negotiates successfully for tobins hat and unsuccessfully for the kids pistol and invites them to share in the common water 
the kid and tobin leave the watering hole and move on through the desert 
the next evening at another watering site they have a surprise-attack shoot-out with the judge who fires a non-fatal shot to tobins neck 
the kid shoots the two horses the judge came with 
as tobin and the kid hide among bones near the desert creek the judge delivers a speech about property rights regarding the shot horses and advises the kid to reveal himself 
ignoring this tobin and the kid continue their travels both wounded and much weakened 
the judge is following the trail and them a few miles behind 
the next day they slightly side-track off the trail and hide hoping to let the judge pass them by and lose their trail 
the judge does repeatedly pass by them quite near and initially unaware and soon addresses them aloud knowing they are nearby and hiding 
although the kid has had three easy clear-shot opportunities to shoot the judge as tobin strongly advises he doesnt take the shots 
the judge and the imbecile then leave 
tobin and the kid are in quite bad shape and would likely have died out in the desert but some benevolent indians rescue them and they survive 
both parties end up in san diego but the kid gets separated from tobin when he is caught by local authorities and imprisoned 
holden visits him in jail stating that he told the jailers the truth that the kid alone was responsible for the end of the glanton gang 
the kid declares that the judge was responsible for the gangs evils but the judge denies it 
after reaching through the cell bars to try to touch the kid holden leaves the kid alone stating that he has errands 
the kid is released and seeks a doctor to treat his wound 
under the influence of medicinal ether he hallucinates that the judge is visiting him along with a curious man who forges coins 
the kid recovers and seeks out tobin with no luck 
he makes his way to los angeles where he witnesses the executions of toadvine and david brownleaving now only tobin whose fate is uncertain the judge and the kid 
the kid again wanders across the american west 
in NUM he makes his way to fort griffin texas and is now referred to by the author as the man 
the lawless city is a center for processing the remains of the american bison which have been hunted nearly to extinction 
at a saloon where a traveling roadshow performs with a trained dancing bear the man yet again meets the judge who does not seem to have aged in the intervening years 
holden calls the man the last of the true and the pair talk on equal terms 
holden describes the man as a disappointment stating that the man held in his heart clemency for the heathen 
holden declares prophetically that the man has arrived at the saloon for the dance 
a drunk man shoots the dancing bear and the man tells the judge you aint nothin and noting the dead bear says that even a dumb animal can dance 
the man hires a prostitute then afterward goes to an outhouse under another meteor shower 
in the outhouse he is surprised by the naked judge there waiting for him who gathers him in his arms against his immense and terrible flesh 
this is the last mention of the man 
as two men from the saloon approach the outhouse another man admonishes them not to open the door 
they do so anyway and gaze in awed horror at what they see stating only good god almighty 
the last paragraph finds the judge back in the saloon dancing in the nude and playing fiddle wildly among the drunkards and prostitutes claiming that he never sleeps and will never die 
a brief epilogue features an unspecified person augering a row of holes across the prairie 
the worker sparks a fire in each of the holes while an assortment of passionless wanderers crosses the row 
the line of holes is described as a validation of sequence and causality as if each round and perfect hole owed its existence to the one before it there on that prairie 
a major theme is the warlike nature of man 
critic harold bloom praised blood meridian as one of the best NUMth century american novels describing it as worthy of herman melvilles moby-dick but admitted that he found the books pervasive violence so shocking that he had several false starts before reading the book entirely 
caryn james argued that the novels violence was a slap in the face to modern readers cut off from the brutality of life while terrence morgan thought that though initially shocking the effect of the violence gradually waned until the reader was bored 
billy j stratton contends that the brutality depicted is the primary mechanism through which mccarthy challenges binaries and promotes his revisionist agenda 
lilley argues that many critics struggle with the fact that mccarthy does not use violence for jury-rigged symbolic plot resolutions  


in mccarthys work violence tends to be just that it is not a sign or symbol of something else 
three epigraphs open the book quotations from french writer paul valry from german christian mystic jacob boehme and a NUM news clipping from the yuma sun reporting the claim of members of an ethiopian archeological excavation that a fossilized skull three hundred millennia old seemed to have been scalped 
the themes implied by the epigraphs have been variously discussed without specific conclusions 
as noted above concerning the ending the most common interpretation of the novel is that holden kills the kid in a fort griffin texas outhouse 
the fact that the kids death is not depicted might be significant 
blood meridian is a catalog of brutality depicting in sometimes explicit detail all manner of violence bloodshed brutality and cruelty 
for the dramatic climax to be left undepicted leaves something of a vacuum for the reader knowing full well the horrors established in the past hundreds of pages the kids unstated fate might still be too awful to describe and too much for the mind to fathom the sight of the kids fate leaves several witnesses stunned almost to silence never in the book does any other character have this response to violence again underlining the singularity of the kids fate 
patrick w shaw argues that holden has sexually violated the protagonist 
as shaw writes the novel had several times earlier established a sequence of events that gives us ample information to visualize how holden molests a child then silences him with aggression 
according to shaws argument holdens actions in the fort griffin outhouse are the culmination of what he desired decades earlier to rape the kid then perhaps kill him to silence the only survivor of the glanton gang 
if the judge wanted only to kill the kid there would be no need for him to undress as he waited in the outhouse 
shaw writes

yet shaws effort to penetrate the mystery in the jakes has not managed to satisfy other critics who have rejected his thesis as more sensational than textual
various discussions by leo daugherty barclay owens harold bloom and others have resulted from the second epigraph of the three which are used by the author to introduce the novel taken from the gnostic mystic jacob boehme 
the quote from boehme reads as follows it is not to be thought that the life of darkness is sunk in misery and lost as if in sorrowing 
there is no sorrowing 
for sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death and death and dying are the very life of the darkness 
no specific conclusions have been reached concerning its interpretation and the extent of its direct or indirect relevance to the novel 
these critics agree that there are gnostic elements present in blood meridian but they disagree on the precise meaning and implication of those elements 
one of the most detailed of these arguments is made by leo daugherty in his NUM article blood meridian as gnostic tragedy 
daugherty argues gnostic thought is central to cormac mccarthys blood meridian daugherty NUM specifically the persian-zoroastrian-manichean branch of gnosticism 
he describes the novel as a rare coupling of gnostic ideology with the affect of hellenic tragedy by means of depicting how power works in the making and erasing of culture and of what the human condition amounts to when a person opposes that power and thence gets introduced to fate 
daugherty sees holden as an archon and the kid as a failed pneuma.
the novels narrator explicitly states that the kid feels a spark of the alien divine
furthermore the kid rarely initiates violence usually doing so only when urged by others or in self-defense 
holden however speaks of his desire to dominate the earth and all who dwell on it by any means from outright violence to deception and trickery 
he expresses his wish to become a suzerain one who rules even when there are other rulers and whose power overrides all others
in NUM bloom did refer to boehme in the context of blood meridian as a very specific type of kabbalistic gnostic
daugherty contends that the staggering violence of the novel can best be understood through a gnostic lens 
evil as defined by the gnostics was a far larger more pervasive presence in human life than the rather tame and domesticated satan of christianity 
as daugherty writes for gnostics evil was simply everything that is with the exception of bits of spirit imprisoned here 
and what they saw is what we see in the world of blood meridian.
barcley owens argues that while there are undoubtedly gnostic qualities to the novel daughertys arguments are ultimately unsuccessful because daugherty fails to address the novels pervasive violence adequately and because he overstates the kids goodness 
another major theme concerning blood meridian involves the subject of theodicy 
theodicy in general refers to the issue of the philosophical or theological attempt to justify the existence of that which is metaphysically or philosophically good in a world which contains so much apparent and manifest evil 
douglas canfield in his essay theodicy in blood meridian in his book mavericks on the border NUM lexington university press asserts that theodicy is the central theme of blood meridian
james wood in his essay for the new yorker entitled red planet from NUM took a similar position to this in recognizing the issue of the general justification of metaphysical goodness in the presence of evil in the world as a recurrent theme in the novel 
this was directly supported by edwin turner on NUM september NUM in his essay on blood meridian for biblioklept
chris dacus in the cormac mccarthy journal for NUM wrote the essay entitled the west as symbol of the eschaton in cormac mccarthy where he expressed his preference for discussing the theme of theodicy in its eschatological terms in comparison to the theological scene of the last judgment 
this preference for reading theodicy as an eschatological theme was further affirmed by harold bloom in his recurrent phrase of referring to the novel as the authentic apocalyptic novel 
while blood meridian initially received little recognition it has since been recognized as mccarthys masterpiece and one of the greatest works of american literature 
aleksandar hemon has called blood meridian possibly the greatest american novel of the past NUM years 
in NUM the new york times conducted a poll of writers and critics regarding the most important works in american fiction from the previous NUM years blood meridian was a runner-up along with john updikes four novels about rabbit angstrom and don delillos underworld while toni morrisons beloved topped the list 
novelist david foster wallace named blood meridian one of the five most underappreciated american novels since NUM and described it as probably the most horrifying book of this century at least in fiction 
academics and critics have variously suggested that blood meridian is nihilistic or strongly moral a satire of the western genre a savage indictment of manifest destiny 
harold bloom called it the ultimate western j douglas canfield described it as a grotesque bildungsroman in which we are denied access to the protagonists consciousness almost entirely 
comparisons have been made to the work of hieronymus bosch and sam peckinpah and of dante alighieri and louis lamour 
however there is no consensus interpretation james d lilley writes that the work seems designed to elude interpretation 
after reading blood meridian richard selzer declared that mccarthy is a genius--also probably somewhat insane 
critic steven shaviro wrote

american literary critic harold bloom praised blood meridian as one of the NUMth centurys finest novels 
time magazine included the novel in its time NUM best english-language novels from NUM to NUM
there have been a number of attempts by different filmmakers to create a motion picture adaptation of blood meridian
however all attempts have failed during the development or pre-production stages 
a common perception is that the story is unfilmable due to its unrelenting violence and dark tone 
in an interview with cormac mccarthy by the wall street journal in NUM mccarthy denied this notion with his perspective being that it would be very difficult to do and would require someone with a bountiful imagination and a lot of balls 
but the payoff could be extraordinary 
screenwriter steve tesich first adapted blood meridian into a screenplay in NUM
in the late NUMs tommy lee jones acquired the film adaptation rights to the story and subsequently rewrote tesichs screenplay with him being attached to direct and play a role in 
according to james franco when he asked jones about the adaptation while on the set of in the valley of elah jones stated that film studios refused to accept the graphic nature of blood meridian without toning down the violence so the production could not move forward 
following the end of production for kingdom of heaven in NUM screenwriter william monahan and director ridley scott entered discussions with producer scott rudin for adapting blood meridian with paramount pictures financing 
in an interview with eclipse magazine published in june NUM scott confirmed that the screenplay had been written but that the extensive violence was proving to be a challenge for film standards 
in a story regarding the film adaptation of the road run by the los angeles times in august NUM it was revealed that scott and monahan had left the project and that rudin would instead be working with screenwriter and director todd field to adapt blood meridian
by early NUM james franco was looking to adapt blood meridian along with a number of other william faulkner and cormac mccarthy novels 
after being persuaded by andrew dominik to adapt the novel franco shot twenty-five minutes of test footage starring scott glenn mark pellegrino luke perry and dave franco 
for undisclosed reasons rudin denied further production of the film 
on may NUM NUM variety revealed that franco was negotiating with rudin to write and direct an adaptation to be brought to the march du film with russell crowe tye sheridan and vincent donofrio starring 
however later that day it was reported that the project dissolved due to issues concerning the film rights

gilead novel

gilead is a novel written by marilynne robinson that was published in NUM
gilead won the NUM pulitzer prize for fiction as well as the national book critics circle award 
it is her second novel following housekeeping which was published in NUM
gilead is described in a study guide for marilynne robinsons gilead published by gale an imprint of cengage learning as an epistolary novel 
in fact the entire narrative is a single continuing albeit episodic document written on several occasions in a form combining a journal and a memoire 
it comprises the fictional autobiography of the reverend john ames an elderly congregationalist pastor in the small secluded town of gilead iowa who knows that he is dying of a heart condition 
at the beginning of the book the date is established as NUM and ames explains that he is writing an account of his life for his seven-year-old son who will have few memories of him 
the book is an account of the memories and legacy of john ames as he remembers his experiences of his father and grandfather to share with his son 
all three men share a vocational lifestyle and profession as congregationalist ministers in gilead iowa 
john ames describes his vocation as giving you a good basic sense of what is being asked of you and also what you might as well ignore explaining that your vocation is something both hard to fulfill and hard to obtain 
he writes that this is one of the most important pieces of wisdom he can bestow to his son 
amess father was a christian pacifist but his grandfather was a radical abolitionist who carried out guerrilla actions with john brown before the american civil war served as a chaplain with the union forces in that war and incited his congregation to join up and serve in it as ames remarks his grandfather preached his people into the war 
the grandfather returned from the war maimed with the loss of his right eye 
thereafter he was given the distinction that his right side was holy or sacred in some way that it was his link to commune with god and he was notorious for a piercing stare with the one eye he had left 
the grandfathers other eccentricities are recalled in his youth the practice of giving all and any of the familys possessions to others and preaching with a gun in a bloodied shirt 
the true character and intimate details of the father are revealed in context with anecdotes regarding the grandfather and mainly in the search for the grave of the grandfather 
one event that is prevalent in the narrators orations is the memory of receiving communion from his father at the remains of a baptist church burned by lightning ames recalls this as an invented memory adapted from his father breaking and sharing an ashy biscuit for lunch
in the course of the novel it quickly emerges that amess first wife louisa died while giving birth to their daughter rebecca ak a 
angeline who also died soon after 
ames reflects on the death of his family as the source of great sorrow for many years in contrast and with special reference to the growing family of the rev 
boughton local presbyterian minister and amess dear and lifelong friend 
many years later ames meets his second wife lila a less-educated woman who appears in church one pentecost sunday 
eventually ames baptizes lila and their relationship develops culminating in her proposal to him 
as ames writes his memoirs boughtons son john ames boughton jack reappears in the town after leaving it in disgrace twenty years earlier following his seduction and abandonment of a girl from a poverty-stricken family near his university 
the daughter of this relationship died poor and uncared-for at the age of three despite the boughton familys well-intended but unwelcome efforts to look after the child 
young boughton the apple of his parents eye but deeply disliked by ames seeks ames out much of the tension in the novel results from amess mistrust of jack boughton and particularly of his relationship with lila and their son 
in the dnouement however it turns out that jack boughton is himself suffering from his forced separation from his own common-law wife an african american from tennessee and their son the family are not allowed to live together because of segregationist laws and her family utterly rejects jack boughton 
it is implied that jacks understanding with lila lies in their common sense of tragedy as she prepares for the death of ames who has given her a security and stability she has never known before 
although there is action in the story its mainspring lies in amess theological struggles on a whole series of fronts with his grandfathers engagement in the civil war with his own loneliness through much of his life with his brothers clear and his fathers apparent loss of belief with his fathers desertion of the town with the hardships of peoples lives and above all with his feelings of hostility and jealousy towards young boughton whom he knows at some level he has to forgive 
amess struggles are illustrated by numerous quotations from the bible from theologians especially calvins institutes of the christian religion and from philosophers especially the atheist feuerbach whom ames greatly respects 
the abstract and theological content of the book is seen through the eyes of ames who is presented in a deeply sympathetic manner and who writes his memoir from a position of serenity despite his suffering and a knowledge of his own limitations and failings 
throughout the novel ames details a reverential awe for the transcendental pathos in the small personal moments of happiness and peace with his wife and son and the town of gilead despite the loneliness and sorrow he feels for leaving the world with things undone and unsolved 
he is able to revel in the beauty of the world around him and takes the time to appreciate and engage with these small wonders at the end of his life 
in this way the novel teaches the importance of stepping back and enjoying present realities 
ames marvels in the every day and commonplace and wishes this attitude for his son also 
he proclaims his desire for his son to live long and  .. love this poor perishable world
ames takes the time to be fully present and intentional in everything that he does no matter how small or insignificant it may seem 
an example of this from the novel is towards the beginning on page NUM when he passes two young men joking around and laughing with one other on the street and ames is filled with a sense of awe at the beauty of such a simple expression of friendship and joy 
in this way ames sees the allure in both the ordinary and mundane as well as the tragic 
he begins to express a viewpoint that the purpose of life is to look for things to appreciate and be thankful for 
in the closing pages of the book ames learns of jack boughtons true situation and is able to offer him the genuine affection and forgiveness he has never before been able to feel for him 
according to robinson the fictional town of gilead gilead means hill of testimony in the bible  genesis NUM is based on the real town of tabor iowa located in the southwest corner of the state and well known for its importance in the abolition movement 
likewise the character of the narrators grandfather is loosely based on the real life story of the rev 
john todd a congregationalist minister from tabor who was a conductor on the underground railroad and who stored weapons supplies and ammunition used by abolitionist john brown in his invasion of missouri in NUM to free a group of slaves and laterwithout todds knowledge or involvementin his NUM raid on the us military arsenal at harpers ferry west virginia 
robinson talks about amess grandfathers involvement in the civil war 
she mentions an illness known as camp fever
the term was generally used to describe typho-malarial fever 
symptoms included pronounced chills followed by fever abdominal tenderness nausea general debility diarrhea retention of urine and furring of the tongue 
also as john ames was describing his sermons in his letter he tells his son that there was one he had burned before he was supposed to preach it 
this sermon was written around the time of the spanish influenza 
regarding robinsons theological influences in gilead she herself has explained the importance of primary calvinist texts particularly calvins institutes of the christian religion
in regard to calvins institutes robinson states in her yves simone lecture entitled the freedom of a christian that one of the reasons these texts are important to me is because they have everything to do with my own theology certainly with my aesthetic perhaps and in so far as i can say i have an intention in writing they have everything to do with my intention 
gilead has been recognized as a text that works to correct modern misconceptions regarding john calvin calvinism and the puritans 
robinson said in a lecture entitled the freedom of a christian that she thinks that one of the things that has happened in american cultural history is that john calvin has been very much misrepresented 
as a consequence of that the parts of american culture that he influenced are very much misrepresented
she expounds upon this idea in her book of essays the death of adam
she writes that the puritans should by no means be characterized by fear or hatred of the body anxiety about sex or denigration of women yet for some reason puritanism is uniquely regarded as synonymous with the preoccupations 
roger kimball in his review of the death of adam in the new york times wrote we all know that the puritans were dour sex-hating joy-abominating folk  except that as robinson shows this widely embraced caricature is a calumny
the common modern characterization of the calvinists as haters of the physical world and joyless exclusivists is the stereotype that robinson works to deconstruct in gilead through a representation of what she considers to be a more accurate understanding of calvinist doctrine that she derives mainly from the original texts specifically calvins institutes of the christian religion
gilead has been the focus of debates on christian multiculturalism in literature 
critics have noted the political resurgence of fundamentalist and evangelical christianity in the last four decades and the impact on literary history of the present 
former president of the united states barack obama lists the novel as one of his favorites on his official facebook profile 
on september NUM NUM in des moines iowa in a reversal of the usual journalistic convention president obama interviewed marilynne robinson for the new york review of books and told her i first picked up gilead one of your most wonderful books here in iowa 
because i was campaigning at the time and theres a lot of downtime when youre driving between towns and when you get home late from campaigning 
... and ive told you thisone of my favorite characters in fiction is a pastor in gilead iowa named john ames who is gracious and courtly and a little bit confused about how to reconcile his faith with all the various travails that his family goes through 
and i was justi just fell in love with the character fell in love with the book ..

j r is a novel by william gaddis published by alfred a knopf in NUM
in the story a schoolboy secretly amasses a fortune in penny stocks 
j r won the national book award for fiction in NUM
it was gaddis first novel since the NUM publication of the recognitions
to complete the novel gaddis received a grant from the rockefeller foundation and the national endowment for the arts 
excerpts of the work were published in the dutton review antaeus and harpers magazine 
j r tells the story of the eponymous j r vansant an NUM-year-old schoolboy who obscures his identity through payphone calls and postal money orders in order to parlay penny stock holdings into a fortune on paper 
the novel broadly satirizes what gaddis called the american dream turned inside out
one critic called it the greatest satirical novel in american literature 
novelist louis auchincloss thought it worthy of swift 
the writing style of j r is intended to mimic gaddis view of contemporary society a chaos of disconnections a blizzard of noise the novel is told almost entirely in dialogue and there is sometimes little indication other than conversational context of which character is speaking 
gaddis later said he did this in order to make the reader a collaborator in the process of creating the characters 
there are also no chapters with transitions between scenes occurring by way of shifts in focalization for example a character who is in a meeting may leave the meeting get in his car and drive off passing as he does so another character who becomes the subject of the next scene without any break in the continuity of the narration though the novel is written in a discontinuous or fragmentary tone
the novel is thus broken only into french scenes or perhaps french chapters
gaddis later advised the reader not to put too much effort into figuring out each word but to read the novel at a normal talking speed it was the flow that i wanted he said for the readers to read and be swept along -- to participate 
and enjoy it 
and occasionally chuckle laugh along the way 
this chaotic writing style may some critics argue reflect gaddis preoccupation with entropy and with the NUMth centurys rejection of newtonian physics the narrative style thus reflecting a quantum and heisenbergian world of waste flux and chaos 
in this world the characters who devise complex systems to acquire as much material wealth as possible are founding their lives on illusion because matter is impermanent and because as gaddis himself wrote in an essay the more complex the message the greater the chance for error 
entropy rears as a central preoccupation of our time 
in j r entropy manifests itself as a malign and centrifugal force of cosmic disruption at work scattering everything in peoples heads homes and work

one of the epicenters of entropy is a seedy run-down tenement apartment on east NUMth street manhattan
the apartment is stacked floor to ceiling with useless goods j r has acquired at bargain prices a blaring radio blocked by those boxes cannot be turned off the faucets always running threaten to flood the apartment and indeed later drown a cat characters flit in and out on useless errands and the clock runs backwards 
one critic compares the craziness of this locale to a marx brothers film and finds it superior 
gaddis lived in a tenement on e NUM st and probably based the fictional apartment in part on his unpleasant experiences there 
gaddis real-life experiences figure in other locales as well 
much of the novel takes place in a desolate nightmarish version of massapequa new york and features a ludicrously dysfunctional school board 
gaddis who in real life spent many years in massapequa and had much of his property seized using eminent domain by the school board there said half in jest that he wrote j r in revenge against massapequa 
one of the most memorable characters in the novel is fired by that school board for independent thinking 
he is mr bast j rs music teacher 
bast is a young composer employed casually by the school 
bast is drawn into assisting j r and becomes a critical link for the development of the business empire j r assembles 
when bast starts at the school his ambition is to write an opera 
as the novel develops he is increasingly burdened by the business accumulations j r makes and his musical ambitions are sidelined 
basts ambitions slide from opera to symphony then to sonata and by the end of the novel he aspires to compose a suite 
the responsibilities that come from being involved with the childish shenanigans of corporate takeovers and asset stripping has had a corrosive effect on basts capacity to create art 
indeed the corrosive effect of todays messy noisy society on everyones capacity to create and appreciate art is a major theme of this noveland arguably of all of gaddis novels 
gaddis later qualified this by stating that when bast and his fellow-artists eigen and gibbs abandon their dreams this is due in part to their own self-destructive nature and when in the last scenes bast begins work on a humble cello piece it represents a real note of hope.
years later gaddis wrote the title character j r into a piece of political satire which the new york times published in NUM
trickle-down economics jr goes to washington is written as the transcript of a us congressional hearing on the federal budget and j r is an official at the office of management and budget 
the adventures of augie march

the adventures of augie march is a picaresque novel by saul bellow published in NUM by viking press 
it features the eponymous augie march who grows up during the great depression and it is an example of bildungsroman tracing the development of an individual through a series of encounters occupations and relationships from boyhood to manhood 
the adventures won the NUM us national book award for fiction 
both time magazine and the modern library board named it one of the hundred best novels in the english language 
when the swedish academy awarded bellow the NUM nobel prize in literature their press release noted that his novels including augie march use a picaresque style that dates back to the earliest origins of the european novel 
however according to the academy bellow uses this episodic traditional form to investigate modern concerns the outer and inner complications that drive us to act or prevent us from acting and that can be called the dilemma of our age 
with an intricate plot and allusive style he explores contrasting themes of alienation and belonging poverty and wealth love and loss with often comic undertones 
its protagonist may be said to represent the modern everymanan individual struggling to make sense of and succeed in an alienating world 
the novel is also specific to the american literary canon in that it celebrates the capacity of the individual to progress in society by virtue of nothing more than his own luck and pluck 
this idea is stated explicitly in the opening and most famous lines of the novel in which the narrator defines himself as an american 
this was an important act of self-definition for the author and narrator both immigrants to america 
it also establishes the dual meaning of america in the novel that is the physical and political america as well as the more figurative american as a state-of-mind

this celebration of the individual determines bellows presentation of fate in the novel 
unlike other picaresque novels such as henry fieldings tom jones the plot of augie march is never pre-determined 
things simply happen to augie one after another with no evident story arc or hint as to where his adventures are leading 
this contributes to the sense that augie as the everyman is lost in a chaotic world but it also enhances the sense that the everyman as an autonomous creation is in control of his own fate 
by turns bellow exposes the alienating forces of the american city while revealing the great opportunities that it offers 
the story describes augie marchs growth from childhood to a fairly stable maturity 
augie with his brother simon and the mentally abnormal george have no father and are brought up by their mother who is losing her eyesight and a tyrannical grandmother-like boarder in very humble circumstances in the rough parts of chicago 
augie drifts from one situation to another in a free-wheeling mannerjobs women homes education and lifestyle 
augie marchs path seems to be partly self made and partly comes around through chance 
in lifestyle he ranges from near adoption by a wealthy couple who spoil him to a struggle for existence stealing books and helping out friends in desperate straits 
his most unusual adventure is his flight to mexico with the wild and irrepressible thea who tries to catch lizards with an eagle 
thea attempts to convince augie to join her in this seemingly impossible task 
his jobs include general assistance to the slightly corrupt einhorn helping in a dog training parlour working for his brother at a coal-tip and working for the congress of industrial organizations until finally he joins the merchant navy in the war 
augie attracts and gets involved with a string of different women 
firstly a casual acquaintance as a youth he gets engaged to a wealthy cousin of his brothers wife 
however through a scandal not of his fault he is discarded 
after a casual affair with sophie a greek hotel maid he is swept off by thea whom he had met when living with the rich renlings and who forecast their relationship even though he loved her sister 
after the fiasco in mexico where he suffered a terrible accident on a horse he and thea began drifting apart he spending his time playing cards and she hunting for snakes and lizards in the mountains 
their inevitable split came the night he agreed to drive another woman stella to another town to escape her troubled boyfriend 
after the break-up augie returned to chicago and picked back up with sophie until joining the merchant navy and heading to new york 
there he met up with stella again and married her 
all through the book augie is encouraged into education but never quite seems to make it he reads a great deal for himself and develops a philosophy of life 
something or somebody always tends to crop up turning his path before augie seriously considers returning to education 
during the war his ship is sunk and he suffers a difficult episode in a lifeboat with a man who turns out to be a lunatic 
after rescue he returns to stella and the book ends with them living a slightly dubious existence in france he involved in some fairly shady business deals and she attempting to pursue a career in acting 
in some ways the adventures of augie march is seen as a dispelling of the traditional idea of an american hero 
he is the american chasing after self-exploration 
he is given a background common of protagonists in inspirational american stories he comes from a poor family he does not know the identity of his father he refuses to be trapped by fine clothing social position or wealth and he has plenty of heroic qualities such as his intelligence compassion and clear observation 
however despite these advantages augie does not truly live out the life of a hero 
he has no commitments of his own and merely goes along with plans and schemes developed by others 
he never truly decides what he wants to do with himself and manages a deep enthusiasm just twice in the novel he falls in love twice ..the first experience fails completely and the second as the novels ends is failing 
everyone around augie finds a greater measure of success than he because they commit themselves to some pursuit or goal even if it is not the most noble 
ultimately though augie has every chance to succeed in the world he never does so because he refuses to engage in that world and instead keeps chasing the vague better fate he has convinced himself he deserves 
through this bellow makes his case that a sharp mind and pure ideals are of no value if they are not coupled with active pursuit and a clear understanding of ones relationship with others 
widely heralded as a classic of american literature the novel was named one of the NUM best novels in the english-language by time magazine best in the history of time NUM to NUM
and by modern library number NUM of the editorial boards NUMth-century hundred
as a novel centering on the quest for identity it has been compared to novels as diverse as the adventures of huckleberry finn moby dick and the catcher in the rye 
john william de forest

john william de forest may NUM NUM  july NUM NUM was an american soldier and writer of realistic fiction best known for his civil war novel miss ravenels conversion from secession to loyalty
de forest was born in seymour connecticut then called humphreysville the son of a prosperous cotton manufacturer 
he did not attend college but instead pursued independent studies mainly abroad where he was a student in latin and became a fluent speaker of french italian and spanish 
while yet a youth he spent four years traveling in europe and two years in the levant residing chiefly in syria 
in NUM he again visited europe making extensive tours through great britain france italy germany greece and asia minor 
from that time he wrote short stories for periodicals having already authored several books 
one of his earliest works the history of the indians of connecticut from the earliest known period to NUM shows his interest in history 
written from NUM to NUM the history of the indians of connecticut is critical of the settlers treatment of the pequots and of king philips war which is somewhat surprising given the early date of the scholarship 
the non-fictional work also foreshadows de forests later fiction in its subject realism and occasional violence 
the honorary degree of a m was conferred upon him by amherst college in NUM
with the advent of the american civil war de forest returned to the united states 
as a captain in the union army he organized a company from new haven the NUMth connecticut volunteers 
he served constantly in the field until january NUM taking an active part under maj gen godfrey weitzels command in the southwestern states and under philip sheridan in the shenandoah valley 
graphic descriptions of battle scenes in louisiana and of sheridans battles in the valley of the shenandoah were published in harpers monthly during the war by major de forest who was present on all the occasions thus mentioned and though experiencing forty-six days under fire received but one trifling wound 
de forest mustered out from the volunteer army in NUM with the brevet rank of major 
after being mustered out of the army with the rest of the veteran reserve corps of which he was the adjutant general de forest transferred to the bureau of refugees freedmen and abandoned lands more commonly known as the freedmens bureau and was appointed assistant commissioner in charge of the post in greenville south carolina 
his experiences there published in magazines of the period and eventually in collected form as a union officer in the reconstruction NUM new edition lsup NUM shed light on the conditions in the south during the reconstruction 
his magazine articles of his time in the army were also collected published posthumously as a volunteers adventures NUM new edition lsup NUM
in NUM de forest published his most significant novel miss ravenels conversion from secession to loyalty
william dean howells praised him as a realist before realism was named but most early critics argued that the romantic elements of de forests plot mixed poorly with the admirable realism of the battle scenes and the novel fell through with the audience in NUM
reeditions in NUM and NUM reintroduced de forest as an author but the full range of his experimentalsm in this early novel has still not been fully understood 
in miss ravenels conversion de forest tried to come to grips with writing experiences de forest himself had and which did not fit any of the idealist and romantic patterns that war literature had followed so far 
consequently there are a number of scenes that portray war with a graphic sense of bloody reality f i the siege of port hudson but there are also burlesque and comical passages as well as reflective moments 
writing for the nation a year later de forest called for a more general movement in american literature toward realism the essays title the great american novel is generally credited as being the first known use of the term 
he died in new haven connecticut of heart disease 
de forest wrote essays a few poems and about fifty short stories numerous military sketches and book reviews most of which were anonymous 
in NUM he contributed to the atlantic monthly a short serial story entitled the lauson tragedy 
his published books include
the grapes of wrath film

the grapes of wrath is a NUM drama film directed by john ford 
it was based on john steinbecks NUM pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name 
the screenplay was written by nunnally johnson and the executive producer was darryl f zanuck 
the film tells the story of the joads an oklahoma family who after losing their farm during the great depression in the NUMs become migrant workers and end up in california 
the motion picture details their arduous journey across the united states as they travel to california in search of work and opportunities for the family members 
the film is widely considered as one of the greatest american films of all time 
in NUM this film was one of the first NUM films to be selected for preservation in the united states national film registry by the library of congress as being culturally historically or aesthetically significant 
the film opens with tom joad henry fonda released from prison and hitchhiking his way back to his parents family farm in oklahoma 
tom finds an itinerant ex-preacher named jim casy john carradine sitting under a tree by the side of the road 
casy was the preacher who baptized tom but now casy has lost the spirit and his faith 
casy goes with tom to the joad property only to find it deserted 
there they meet muley graves john qualen who is hiding out 
in a flashback he describes how farmers all over the area were forced from their farms by the deed holders of the land 
a local boy irving bacon hired for the purpose is shown knocking down muleys house with a caterpillar tractor 
the large joad family of twelve leaves at daybreak along with casy who decides to accompany them 
they pack everything into a dilapidated NUM hudson super six sedan adapted to serve as a truck in order to make the long journey to the promised land of california 
the trip along highway NUM is arduous and it soon takes a toll on the joad family 
the elderly grandpa charley grapewin dies along the way 
tom writes the circumstances surrounding the death on a page from the family bible and places it on the body before they bury it so that if his remains were found his death would not be investigated as a possible homicide 
they park in a camp and meet a man a migrant returning from california who laughs at pas optimism about conditions in california 
he speaks bitterly about his experiences in the west 
the family arrives at the first transient migrant campground for workers and finds the camp is crowded with other starving jobless and desperate travelers 
their truck slowly makes its way through the dirt road between the shanty houses and around the camps hungry-faced inhabitants 
tom says sure dont look none too prosperous 
after some trouble with a so-called agitator the joads leave the camp in a hurry 
the joads make their way to another migrant camp the keene ranch 
after doing some work in the fields they discover the high food prices in the company store for meat and other products 
the store is the only one in the area by a long shot 
later they find a group of migrant workers are striking and tom wants to find out all about it 
he goes to a secret meeting in the dark woods 
when the meeting is discovered casy is killed by one of the camp guards 
as tom tries to defend casy from the attack he inadvertently kills the guard 
tom suffers a serious wound on his cheek and the camp guards realize it will not be difficult to identify him 
that evening the family hides tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them they are searching for the man who killed the guard 
tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the keene ranch without further incident 
after driving for a while they have to stop at the top of a hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt they have little gas but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights 
the lights are from a third type of camp farmworkers wheat patch camp weedpatch in the book a clean camp run by the department of agriculture complete with indoor toilets and showers which the joad children had never seen before 
tom is moved to work for change by what he has witnessed in the various camps 
he tells his family that he plans to carry on casys mission in the world by fighting for social reform 
he leaves to seek a new world and to join the movement committed to social justice 
tom joad says

ill be all around in the dark 
ill be everywhere 
wherever you can look wherever theres a fight so hungry people can eat ill be there 
wherever theres a cop beatin up a guy ill be there 
ill be in the way guys yell when theyre mad 
ill be in the way kids laugh when theyre hungry and they know suppers ready and when the people are eatin the stuff they raise and livin in the houses they build ill be there too 
as the family moves on again they discuss the fear and difficulties they have had 
ma joad concludes the film saying

i aint never gonna be scared no more 
i was though 
for a while it looked as though we was beat 
good and beat 
looked like we didnt have nobody in the whole wide world but enemies 
like nobody was friendly no more 
made me feel kinda bad and scared too like we was lost and nobody cared .. rich fellas come up and they die and their kids aint no good and they die out but we keep a-coming 
were the people that live 
they cant wipe us out they cant lick us 
well go on forever pa cos were the people 
according to the new york times the grapes of wrath was the best-selling book of NUM and NUM copies had been printed by february NUM
in that month it won the national book award favorite fiction book of NUM voted by members of the american booksellers association 
soon it won the pulitzer prize for fiction 
in NUM the nobel prize committee cited the grapes of wrath as a great work and as one of the committees main reasons for granting steinbeck the nobel prize for literature 
time magazine included the novel in its time NUM best english-language novels from NUM to NUM
in NUM the daily telegraph also included the novel in its NUM novels everyone should read
in NUM the modern library ranked the grapes of wrath tenth on its list of the NUM best english-language novels of the NUMth century 
the first part of the film follows the book fairly closely 
however the second half and the ending in particular are significantly different from the book 
while the book ends with the downfall and break-up of the joad family the film switches the order of sequences so that the family ends up in a good camp provided by the government and events turn out relatively well 
the novels original ending was considered far too controversial to be included in the film 
in the novel rose-of-sharon rosasharn rivers played in the film by dorris bowdon gives birth to a stillborn baby 
later she offers her milk-filled breasts to a starving man dying in a barn 
these scenes were not included in the film 
while the film is somewhat stark it has a more optimistic and hopeful view than the novel especially when the joads land at the department of agriculture camp  the clean camp 
also the producers decided to tone down steinbecks political references such as eliminating a monologue using a land owners description of reds as anybody that wants thirty cents an hour when were payin twenty-five to show that under the prevalent conditions that definition applies to every migrant worker looking for better wages 
the film emphasizes ma joads pragmatic forward-looking way of dealing with their situation despite toms departure as it concludes with her spiritual were the people speech 
ivy and sairy wilson who attend to grandpas death and travel with the joads until they reach california are left out of the movie 
noahs departure from the family is passed over in the movie 
instead he simply disappears without explanation 
in the book floyd tells tom about how the workers were being exploited but in the movie he does not appear until after the deputy arrives in hooverville 
sandry the religious fanatic who scares rose of sharon is left out of the movie 
vivian sobchack argued that the film uses visual imagery to focus on the joads as a family unit whereas the novel focuses on their journey as a part of the family of man
she points out that their farm is never shown in detail and that the family members are never shown working in agriculture not a single peach is shown in the entire film 
this subtly serves to focus the film on the specific family as opposed to the novels focus on man and land together 
in the film most family members are either reduced such as al noah and uncle john to background characters or like rose of sharon and connie to being the focus of only one or two relatively minor scenes 
instead the film is largely concerned with tom ma and to a lesser extent jim casy 
thus despite the films focus on the joads as a specific family rather than a part of the family of man the movie explores very little of the members of the family itself 
according to critic roger ebert both executive producer darryl f zanuck and director john ford were odd choices to make this film because both were considered politically conservative 
zanuck was nervous about the left-wing political views of the novel especially the ending 
due to the red-baiting common to the era darryl zanuck sent private investigators to oklahoma to help him legitimize the film 
when zanucks investigators found that the okies predicament was indeed terrible zanuck was confident he could defend political attacks that the film was somehow pro-communist 
ebert believes that world war ii also helped sell the films message as communism received a brief respite from american demonizing during that period 
production on the film began on october NUM NUM and was completed on november NUM NUM
some of the filming locations include mcalester sayre both in oklahoma gallup laguna pueblo and santa rosa all in new mexico lamont needles san fernando valley all in california topock petrified forest national park all in arizona 
the film score by alfred newman is based on the song red river valley
additionally the song goin down the road feelin bad is sung in a nighttime scene at a labor camp 
the film premiered in new york city on january NUM NUM and los angeles on january NUM NUM
the wide release date in the united states was march NUM NUM
originally allowed to be shown in the soviet union in NUM because of its depiction of the plight of people under capitalism it was subsequently withdrawn because audiences were noticing that as shown in the film even the poorest americans could afford a car 
frank nugent of the new york times wrote

in the vast library where the celluloid literature of the screen is stored there is one small uncrowded shelf devoted to the cinemas masterworks to those films which by dignity of theme and excellence of treatment seem to be of enduring artistry seem destined to be recalled not merely at the end of their particular year but whenever great motion pictures are mentioned 
to that shelf of screen classics twentieth century-fox yesterday added its version of john steinbecks the grapes of wrath adapted by nunnally johnson directed by john ford and performed at the rivoli by a cast of such uniform excellence and suitability that we should be doing its other members an injustice by saying it was headed by henry fonda jane darwell john carradine and russell simpson 
when critic bosley crowther retired in NUM he named the grapes of wrath one of the best fifty films ever made 
nb 
 NUM percent of the works crowther named were not american-made so he was placing this work in a large context 
in a film review written for time magazine by its editor whittaker chambers he separated his views of steinbecks novel from fords film which he liked 
chambers wrote

but people who go to pictures for the sake of seeing pictures will see a great one 
for the grapes of wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book ..camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the steinbeck book 
cleared of excrescences the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people who damned the novels phony conclusions read it 
it is the saga of an authentic us farming family who lose their land 
they wander they suffer but they endure 
they are never quite defeated and their survival is itself a triumph 
a review in variety reported here is outstanding entertainment projected against a heart-rending sector of the american scene concluding it possesses an adult viewpoint and its success may lead other producers to explore the rich field of contemporary life which films long have neglected and ignored 
john mosher wrote in the new yorker with a majesty never before so constantly sustained on any screen the film never for an instant falters 
its beauty is of the sort found in the art of burchfield benton and curry as the landscape and people involved belong to the world of these painters

fitzgerald played on the NUM newman football team 
at newman he met father sigourney fay who noticed his incipient talent with the written word and encouraged him to pursue his literary ambitions 
after graduating from the newman school in NUM fitzgerald decided to stay in new jersey to continue his artistic development at princeton university 
he tried out for the college football team but was cut the first day of practice 
he firmly dedicated himself at princeton to honing his craft as a writer and became friends with future critics and writers edmund wilson and john peale bishop 
he wrote for the princeton triangle club the nassau lit and the princeton tiger
he also was involved in the american whig-cliosophic society which ran the nassau lit
his absorption in the trianglea kind of musical-comedy societyled to his submission of a novel to charles scribners sons where the editor praised the writing but ultimately rejected the book 
four of the universitys eating clubs sent him bids at midyear and he chose the university cottage club where fitzgeralds desk and writing materials are still displayed in its library known as the big four club that was most committed to the ideal of the fashionable gentleman 
fitzgeralds writing pursuits at princeton came at the expense of his coursework however causing him to be placed on academic probation and in NUM he dropped out of university to join the army 
during the winter of NUM fitzgerald was stationed at fort leavenworth and was a student of future united states president and general of the army dwight eisenhower whom he intensely disliked 
worried that he might die in the war with his literary dreams unfulfilled fitzgerald hastily wrote the romantic egotist in the weeks before reporting for dutyand although scribners rejected it the reviewer noted his novels originality and encouraged fitzgerald to submit more work in the future 
it was while attending princeton that fitzgerald met chicago socialite and debutante ginevra king on a visit back home in st paul 
immediately infatuated with her according to mizner fitzgerald remained devoted to ginevra as long as she would allow him to and wrote to her daily the incoherent expressive letters all young lovers write 
she would become his inspiration for the character of isabelle borg amory blaines first love in this side of paradise for daisy in the great gatsby and several other characters in his novels and short stories 
fitzgerald was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry and assigned to camp sheridan outside of montgomery alabama 
while at a country club fitzgerald met and fell in love with zelda sayre a daughter of alabama supreme court justice anthony d sayre and the golden girl in fitzgeralds terms of montgomery society 
the war ended in NUM before fitzgerald was ever deployed 
upon his discharge he moved to new york city hoping to launch a career in advertising that would be lucrative enough to convince zelda to marry him 
he worked for the barron collier advertising agency living in a single room at NUM claremont avenue in the morningside heights neighborhood on manhattans west side 
zelda accepted his marriage proposal but after some time and despite working at an advertising firm and writing short stories he was unable to convince her that he would be able to support her leading her to break off the engagement 
fitzgerald returned to his parents house at NUM summit avenue on cathedral hill in st paul to revise the romantic egotist recast as this side of paradise a semi-autobiographical account of fitzgeralds undergraduate years at princeton 
fitzgerald was so short of money that he took up a job repairing car roofs 
his revised novel was accepted by scribners in the fall of NUM and was published on march NUM NUM and became an instant success selling NUM copies in the first year 
it launched fitzgeralds career as a writer and provided a steady income suitable to zeldas needs 
they resumed their engagement and were married at st patricks cathedral new york 
their daughter and only child frances scott scottie fitzgerald was born on october NUM NUM
paris in the NUMs proved the most influential decade of fitzgeralds development 
fitzgerald made several excursions to europe mostly paris and the french riviera and became friends with many members of the american expatriate community in paris notably ernest hemingway 
fitzgeralds friendship with hemingway was quite effusive as many of fitzgeralds relationships would prove to be 
hemingway did not get on well with zelda however and in addition to describing her as insane in his memoir a moveable feast hemingway claimed that zelda encouraged her husband to drink so as to distract fitzgerald from his work on his novel so he could work on the short stories he sold to magazines to help support their lifestyle 
like most professional authors at the time fitzgerald supplemented his income by writing short stories for such magazines as the saturday evening post colliers weekly and esquire and sold his stories and novels to hollywood studios 
this whoring as fitzgerald and subsequently hemingway called these sales was a sore point in the two authors friendship 
fitzgerald claimed that he would first write his stories in an authentic manner then rewrite them to put in the twists that made them into salable magazine stories 
although fitzgeralds passion lay in writing novels only his first novel sold well enough to support the opulent lifestyle that he and zelda adopted as new york celebrities 
the great gatsby now considered to be his masterpiece did not become popular until after fitzgeralds death 
because of this lifestyle as well as the bills from zeldas medical care when they came fitzgerald was constantly in financial trouble and often required loans from his literary agent harold ober and his editor at scribners maxwell perkins 
when ober decided not to continue advancing money to fitzgerald the author severed ties with his longtime friend and agent 
fitzgerald offered a good-hearted and apologetic tribute to this support in the late short story financing finnegan 
fitzgerald began working on his fourth novel during the late NUMs but was sidetracked by financial difficulties that necessitated his writing commercial short stories and by the schizophrenia that struck zelda in NUM
her emotional health remained fragile for the rest of her life 
in february NUM she was hospitalized at the phipps clinic at johns hopkins in baltimore maryland 
during this time fitzgerald rented the la paix estate in the suburb of towson maryland to work on his latest book the story of the rise and fall of dick diver a promising young psychiatrist who falls in love with and marries nicole warren one of his patients 
the book went through many versions the first of which was to be a story of matricide 
some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled autobiographical novel recounting fitzgeralds problems with his wife the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle his own egoism and self-confidence and his continuing alcoholism 
indeed fitzgerald was extremely protective of his material ie  their life together
when zelda wrote and sent to scribners her own fictional version of their lives in europe save me the waltz fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novels publication and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his material which included their relationship 
his book was finally published in NUM as tender is the night
critics who had waited nine years for the followup to the great gatsby had mixed opinions about the novel 
most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations 
the novel did not sell well upon publication but like the earlier gatsby the books reputation has since risen significantly 
fitzgeralds alcoholism and financial difficulties in addition to zeldas mental illness made for difficult years in baltimore 
he was hospitalized nine times at johns hopkins hospital and his friend h l mencken noted in a NUM letter that the case of f scott fitzgerald has become distressing 
he is boozing in a wild manner and has become a nuisance 
in NUM fitzgerald was invited by producer john w considine jr  to temporarily relocate to hollywood in order to write a flapper comedy for united artists 
scott and zelda moved into a studio-owned bungalow in january of the following year and fitzgerald soon met and began an affair with lois moran 
the starlet became a temporary muse for the author and he rewrote rosemary hoyt one of the central characters in tender is the night who had been a male in earlier drafts to closely mirror her 
the trip exacerbated the couples marital difficulties and they left hollywood after two months 
in the ensuing years zelda became increasingly violent and emotionally distressed and in NUM fitzgerald had her placed in the highland hospital in asheville north carolina 
although he reportedly found movie work degrading fitzgerald continued to struggle financially and entered into a lucrative exclusive deal with metro-goldwyn-mayer in NUM that necessitated him moving to hollywood where he earned his highest annual income up to that point NUM.NUM
he also began a high-profile live-in affair with movie columnist sheilah graham 
the projects fitzgerald worked on for the studio included a never filmed draft for gone with the wind and revisions on madame curie for which he received no credits 
he also spent time during this period working on his fifth and final novel the love of the last tycoon published posthumously as the last tycoon based on film executive irving thalberg 
in NUM mgm terminated the contract and fitzgerald became a freelance screenwriter 
during his work on winter carnival fitzgerald went on an alcoholic binge and was treated by new york psychiatrist richard h hoffmann 
from NUM until his death in NUM fitzgerald mocked himself as a hollywood hack through the character of pat hobby in a sequence of NUM short stories later collected as the pat hobby stories which garnered many positive reviews 
the pat hobby stories were originally published in esquire between january NUM and july NUM even after fitzgeralds death 
us census records show his official address at this time to be the estate of edward everett horton in encino california in the san fernando valley 
fitzgerald an alcoholic since college became notorious during the NUMs for his extraordinarily heavy drinking undermining his health by the late NUMs 
according to zeldas biographer nancy milford fitzgerald claimed that he had contracted tuberculosis but milford dismisses it as a pretext to cover his drinking problems 
however fitzgerald scholar matthew j bruccoli contends that fitzgerald did in fact have recurring tuberculosis and according to nancy milford fitzgerald biographer arthur mizener said that fitzgerald suffered a mild attack of tuberculosis in NUM and in NUM he had what proved to be a tubercular hemorrhage 
some have said that the writers hemorrhage was caused by bleeding from esophageal varices 
fitzgerald suffered two heart attacks in the late NUMs 
after the first in schwabs drug store he was ordered by his doctor to avoid strenuous exertion 
he moved in with the gossip columnist sheilah graham who lived in hollywood on north hayworth avenue one block east of fitzgeralds apartment on north laurel avenue 
the following day as fitzgerald ate a candy bar and made notes in his newly arrived princeton alumni weekly graham saw him jump from his armchair grab the mantelpiece gasp and fall to the floor 
she ran to the manager of the building harry culver founder of culver city 
upon entering the apartment to assist fitzgerald he stated im afraid hes dead 
fitzgerald had died of a heart attack at age NUM
dr clarence h nelson fitzgeralds physician signed the death certificate 
fitzgeralds body was moved to the pierce brothers mortuary 
among the attendees at a visitation held at a funeral home was dorothy parker who reportedly cried and murmured the poor son-of-a-bitch a line from jay gatsbys funeral in fitzgeralds the great gatsby
his body was transported to maryland where his funeral was attended by twenty or thirty people in bethesda among the attendees were his only child frances scottie fitzgerald lanahan smith then age NUM and his editor maxwell perkins 
at the time of his death the roman catholic church declined the familys request that fitzgerald a non-practicing catholic celebrated for his risqu and provocative jazz age writings be buried in the family plot in the catholic saint marys cemetery in rockville maryland 
fitzgerald was originally buried in rockville union cemetery 
zelda fitzgerald died in NUM in a fire at the highland mental hospital in asheville north carolina 
in NUM scottie successfully petitioned to have the earlier decision revisited and her parents remains were moved to the family plot in saint marys 
fitzgerald died before he could complete the last tycoon
his manuscript which included extensive notes for the unwritten part of the novels story was edited by his friend the literary critic edmund wilson and published in NUM as the last tycoon
in NUM the book was reissued under the original title the love of the last tycoon which is now agreed to have been fitzgeralds preferred title 
in NUM an editor of the strand magazine discovered and published for the first time an NUM-word manuscript dated july NUM of a fitzgerald short-story titled temperature 
long thought lost fitzgeralds manuscript for the story was found in the rare books and manuscript archives at princeton university fitzgeralds alma mater 
as described by strand temperature set in los angeles tells the story of the failure illness and decline of a once successful writer and his life among hollywood idols while suffering lingering fevers and indulging in light-hearted romance 
the protagonist is a NUM-year-old self-destructive alcoholic named emmet monsen whom fitzgerald describes in his story as notably photogenic slender and darkly handsome 
it tells of his personal relationships as his health declines with various doctors personal assistants and a hollywood actress who is his lover 
as for that current dodge no reference to any living character is intended  no use even trying that fitzgerald writes at the beginning of the story 
fitzgerald bibliographies have previously listed the story sometimes referred to as the women in the house as unpublished or as lost  mentioned in correspondence but no surviving transcript or manuscript 
fitzgeralds work has inspired writers ever since he was first published 
the publication of the great gatsby prompted t s eliot to write in a letter to fitzgerald it seems to me to be the first step that american fiction has taken since henry james .. don birnam the protagonist of charles jacksons the lost weekend says to himself referring to the great gatsby theres no such thing .. as a flawless novel 
but if there is this is it 
in letters written in the NUMs j d salinger expressed admiration of fitzgeralds work and his biographer ian hamilton wrote that salinger even saw himself for some time as fitzgeralds successor 
richard yates a writer often compared to fitzgerald called the great gatsby the most nourishing novel he read .. a miracle of talent .. a triumph of technique 
it was written in a new york times editorial after his death that fitzgerald was better than he knew for in fact and in the literary sense he invented a generation .
he might have interpreted them and even guided them as in their middle years they saw a different and nobler freedom threatened with destruction

lee has described it as a third-floor apartment facing out back
lee and his brother shared the bedroom while their parents slept on a foldout couch 
lee attended dewitt clinton high school in the bronx 
in his youth lee enjoyed writing and entertained dreams of one day writing the great american novel

he graduated from high school early aged NUM in NUM and joined the wpa federal theatre project 
with the help of his uncle robbie solomon lee became an assistant in NUM at the new timely comics division of pulp magazine and comic-book publisher martin goodmans company 
timely by the NUMs would evolve into marvel comics 
lee whose cousin jean was goodmans wife was formally hired by timely editor joe simon 
his duties were prosaic at first 
in those days the artists dipped the pen in ink so i had to make sure the inkwells were filled lee recalled in NUM
i went down and got them their lunch i did proofreading i erased the pencils from the finished pages for them
marshaling his childhood ambition to be a writer young stanley lieber made his comic-book debut with the text filler captain america foils the traitors revenge in captain america comics NUM cover-dated may NUM using the pseudonym stan lee which years later he would adopt as his legal name 
lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that he had intended to save his given name for more literary work 
this initial story also introduced captain americas trademark ricocheting shield-toss 
he graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature headline hunter foreign correspondent two issues later 
lees first superhero co-creation was the destroyer in mystic comics NUM august NUM
other characters he co-created during this period fans and historians call the golden age of comic books include jack frost debuting in us a comics NUM august NUM and father time debuting in captain america comics NUM august NUM
when simon and his creative partner jack kirby left late in NUM following a dispute with goodman the NUM-year-old publisher installed lee just under NUM years old as interim editor 
the youngster showed a knack for the business that led him to remain as the comic-book divisions editor-in-chief as well as art director for much of that time until NUM when he would succeed goodman as publisher 
lee entered the united states army in early NUM and served in the us in the signal corps repairing telegraph poles and other communications equipment 
he was later transferred to the training film division where he worked writing manuals training films and slogans and occasionally cartooning 
his military classification he says was playwright he adds that only nine men in the us army were given that title 
vincent fago editor of timelys animation comics section which put out humor and funny animal comics filled in until lee returned from his world war ii military service in NUM
in the mid-NUMs by which time the company was now generally known as atlas comics lee wrote stories in a variety of genres including romance westerns humor science fiction medieval adventure horror and suspense 
in the NUMs lee teamed up with his comic book colleague dan decarlo to produce the syndicated newspaper strip my friend irma based on the radio comedy starring marie wilson 
by the end of the decade lee had become dissatisfied with his career and considered quitting the field 
in the late NUMs dc comics editor julius schwartz revived the superhero archetype and experienced a significant success with its updated version of the flash and later with super-team the justice league of america 
in response publisher martin goodman assigned lee to come up with a new superhero team 
lees wife suggested him to experiment with stories he preferred since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose 
lee acted on that advice giving his superheroes a flawed humanity a change from the ideal archetypes that were typically written for preteens 
before this most superheroes were idealistically perfect people with no serious lasting problems 
lee introduced complex naturalistic characters who could have bad tempers fits of melancholy and vanity they bickered amongst themselves worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends got bored or even were sometimes physically ill 
the first superhero group lee and artist jack kirby created together was the fantastic four based on previous kirby superhero team challengers of the unknown published by dc comics the teams immediate popularity led lee and marvels illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles 
again working with kirby lee co-created the hulk thor iron man and the x-men with bill everett daredevil and with steve ditko doctor strange and marvels most successful character spider-man all of whom lived in a thoroughly shared universe 
lee and kirby gathered several of their newly created characters together into the team title the avengers and would revive characters from the NUMs such as the sub-mariner and captain america 
comics historian peter sanderson wrote that in the NUMs
lees revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators 
he introduced the practice of regularly including a credit panel on the splash page of each story naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer 
regular news about marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the bullpen bulletins page which like the letter columns that appeared in each title was written in a friendly chatty style 
lee has said that his goal was for fans to think of the comics creators as friends and considered it a mark of his success on this front that at a time when letters to other comics publishers were typically addressed dear editor letters to marvel addressed the creators by first name eg 
dear stan and jack
by NUM the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a march NUM wbai radio program with lee and kirby as guests was titled will success spoil spiderman sic
throughout the NUMs lee scripted art-directed and edited most of marvels series moderated the letters pages wrote a monthly column called stans soapbox and wrote endless promotional copy often signing off with his trademark motto excelsior
which is also the new york state motto
to maintain his workload and meet deadlines he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios but due to lees success with it became known as the marvel method
typically lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script 
based on the synopsis the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling 
after the artist turned in penciled pages lee would write the word balloons and captions and then oversee the lettering and coloring 
in effect the artists were co-plotters whose collaborative first drafts lee built upon 
lee recorded messages to the newly formed merry marvel marching society fan club in NUM
following ditkos departure from marvel in NUM john romita sr became lees collaborator on the amazing spider-man
within a year it overtook fantastic four to become the companys top seller

in retrospect it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the marvel age

the comics code authority refused to grant its seal because the stories depicted drug use the anti-drug context was considered irrelevant 
with goodmans cooperation and confident that the original government request would give him credibility lee had the story published without the seal 
the comics sold well and marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts 
the cca subsequently loosened the code to permit negative depictions of drugs among other new freedoms

he considered studying special education but dropped out the following spring 
that fall his father urged him to learn about the meat-importing business and he went to work at a company in the austrian city of vienna and the polish city of bydgoszcz 
surprisingly salinger went willingly but he was so disgusted by the slaughterhouses that after that he firmly decided to embark on a different career path 
his disgust for the meat business and his rejection of his father probably had a lot to do with his vegetarianism as an adult

he dropped out after one semester

in late NUM salinger briefly worked on a caribbean cruise ship serving as an activity director and possibly as a performer 
the same year salinger began submitting short stories to the new yorker
seven of salingers stories were rejected by the magazine that year including lunch for three monologue for a watery highball and i went to school with adolf hitler
in december NUM however the publication accepted slight rebellion off madison a manhattan-set story about a disaffected teenager named holden caulfield with pre-war jitters
when japan carried out the attack on pearl harbor that month the story was rendered unpublishable it did not appear in the magazine until NUM
in the spring of NUM several months after the united states entered world war ii salinger was drafted into the army wherein he saw combat with the NUMth infantry regiment NUMth infantry division 
he was present at utah beach on d-day in the battle of the bulge and the battle of hrtgen forest 
during the campaign from normandy into germany salinger arranged to meet with ernest hemingway a writer who had influenced him and was then working as a war correspondent in paris 
salinger was impressed with hemingways friendliness and modesty finding him more soft than his gruff public persona 
hemingway was impressed by salingers writing and remarked jesus he has a helluva talent 
the two writers began corresponding salinger wrote hemingway in july NUM that their talks were among his few positive memories of the war 
salinger added that he was working on a play about holden caulfield the protagonist of his story slight rebellion off madison and hoped to play the part himself 
salinger was assigned to a counter-intelligence unit for which he used his proficiency in french and german to interrogate prisoners of war 
in april NUM he entered a liberated concentration camp probably one of dachaus sub-camps 
salinger earned the rank of staff sergeant and served in five campaigns 
salingers experiences in the war affected him emotionally 
he was hospitalized for a few weeks for combat stress reaction after germany was defeated and he later told his daughter you never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely no matter how long you live 
both of his biographers speculate that salinger drew upon his wartime experiences in several stories such as for esmwith love and squalor which is narrated by a traumatized soldier 
salinger continued to write while serving in the army publishing several stories in slick magazines such as colliers and the saturday evening post
he also continued to submit stories to the new yorker but with little success it rejected all of his submissions from NUM to NUM a group of NUMpoems in NUM alone 
after germanys defeat salinger signed up for a six-month period of denazification duty in germany for the counterintelligence corps 
he lived in weissenburg and soon after married sylvia welter 
he brought her to the united states in april NUM but the marriage fell apart after eight months and sylvia returned to germany 
in NUM salingers daughter margaret was with him when he received a letter from sylvia 
he looked at the envelope and without reading it tore it apart 
it was the first time he had heard from her since the breakup but as margaret put it when he was finished with a person he was through with them 
in NUM whit burnett agreed to help salinger publish a collection of his short stories through story presss lippincott imprint 
titled the young folks the collection was to consist of twenty storiesten like the title story and slight rebellion off madison were already in print ten were previously unpublished 
though burnett implied the book would be published and even negotiated salinger a NUM advance on its sale lippincott overruled burnett and rejected the book 
salinger blamed burnett for the books failure to see print and the two became estranged 
by the late NUMs salinger had become an avid follower of zen buddhism to the point that he gave reading lists on the subject to his dates and arranged a meeting with buddhist scholar d t suzuki 
in NUM the author submitted a short story titled simply the bananafish to the new yorker
william maxwell the magazines fiction editor was impressed enough with the singular quality of the story that the magazine asked salinger to continue revising it 
he spent a year reworking it with new yorker editors and the magazine accepted the story now titled a perfect day for bananafish and published it in the january NUM NUM issue 
the magazine thereon offered salinger a first-look contract that allowed them right of first refusal on any future stories 
the critical acclaim accorded bananafish coupled with problems salinger had with stories being altered by the slicks led him to publish almost exclusively in the new yorker
bananafish was also the first of salingers published stories to feature the glasses a fictional family consisting of two retired vaudeville performers and their seven precocious children seymour buddy boo boo walt waker zooey and franny 
salinger eventually published seven stories about the glasses developing a detailed family history and focusing particularly on seymour the brilliant but troubled eldest child 
in the early NUMs salinger had confided in a letter to whit burnett that he was eager to sell the film rights to some of his stories in order to achieve financial security 
according to ian hamilton salinger was disappointed when rumblings from hollywood over his NUM short story the varioni brothers came to nothing 
therefore he immediately agreed when in mid-NUM independent film producer samuel goldwyn offered to buy the film rights to his short story uncle wiggily in connecticut
though salinger sold his story with the hopein the words of his agent dorothy oldingthat it would make a good movie the film version of wiggily was lambasted by critics upon its release in NUM
renamed my foolish heart and starring dana andrews and susan hayward the melodramatic film departed to such an extent from salingers story that goldwyn biographer a scott berg referred to it as a bastardization
as a result of this experience salinger never again permitted film adaptations to be made from his work 
when brigitte bardot wanted to buy the rights to a perfect day for bananafish salinger refused the request but told his friend lillian ross longtime staff writer for the new yorker shes a cute talented lost enfante and im tempted to accommodate her pour le sport.
in the NUMs salinger confided to several people that he was working on a novel featuring holden caulfield the teenage protagonist of his short story slight rebellion off madison and the catcher in the rye was published on july NUM NUM by little brown and company 
the novels plot is simple detailing NUM-year-old holdens experiences in new york city following his expulsion and departure from an elite college preparatory school 
not only was he expelled from his current school he had also been expelled from three previous schools 
the book is more notable for the persona and testimonial voice of its first-person narrator holden 
he serves as an insightful but unreliable narrator who expounds on the importance of loyalty the phoniness of adulthood and his own duplicity 
in a NUM interview with a high school newspaper salinger admitted that the novel was sort of autobiographical explaining my boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book .. it was a great relief telling people about it 
initial reactions to the book were mixed ranging from the new york times hailing catcher as an unusually brilliant first novel to denigrations of the books monotonous language and the immorality and perversion of holden who uses religious slurs and freely discusses casual sex and prostitution 
the novel was a popular success within two months of its publication the catcher in the rye had been reprinted eight times 
it spent NUM weeks on the new york times bestseller list 
the books initial success was followed by a brief lull in popularity but by the late NUMs according to ian hamilton it had become the book all brooding adolescents had to buy the indispensable manual from which cool styles of disaffectation could be borrowed 
it has been compared to mark twains the adventures of huckleberry finn
newspapers began publishing articles about the catcher cult and the novel was banned in several countriesas well as some us schoolsbecause of its subject matter and what catholic world reviewer riley hughes called an excessive use of amateur swearing and coarse language
according to one angry parents tabulation NUM instances of goddamn NUM uses of bastard NUM chrissakes and one incident of flatulence constituted what was wrong with salingers book 
in the NUMs several us high school teachers who assigned the book were fired or forced to resign 
a NUM study of censorship noted that the catcher in the rye had the dubious distinction of being at once the most frequently censored book across the nation and the second-most frequently taught novel in public high schools after john steinbecks of mice and men
the book remains widely read in NUM the novel was selling about NUM copies per year with total worldwide sales over NUM million copies
in the wake of its NUMs success salinger received and rejected numerous offers to adapt the catcher in the rye for the screen including one from samuel goldwyn 
since its publication there has been sustained interest in the novel among filmmakers with billy wilder harvey weinstein and steven spielberg among those seeking to secure the rights 
salinger stated in the NUMs that jerry lewis tried for years to get his hands on the part of holden 
salinger repeatedly refused though and in NUM joyce maynard definitively concluded the only person who might ever have played holden caulfield would have been j d 
salinger 
in a july NUM profile in book of the month club news salingers friend and new yorker editor william maxwell asked salinger about his literary influences 
salinger responded a writer when hes asked to discuss his craft ought to get up and call out in a loud voice just the names of the writers he loves 
i love kafka flaubert tolstoy chekhov dostoevsky proust ocasey rilke lorca keats rimbaud burns e bront jane austen henry james blake coleridge 
i wont name any living writers 
i dont think its right although ocasey was in fact living at the time
in letters written in the NUMs salinger had expressed his admiration of three living or recently deceased writers sherwood anderson ring lardner and f scott fitzgerald ian hamilton wrote that salinger even saw himself for some time as fitzgeralds successor
salingers a perfect day for bananafish has an ending similar to that of fitzgeralds earlier published short story may day
salinger wrote friends of a momentous change in his life in NUM after several years of practicing zen buddhism while reading the gospel of sri ramakrishna about hindu religious teacher sri ramakrishna 
he became an adherent of ramakrishnas advaita vedanta hinduism which advocated celibacy for those seeking enlightenment and detachment from human responsibilities such as family 
salingers religious studies were reflected in some of his writing 
the story teddy features a ten-year-old child who expresses vedantic insights 
he also studied the writings of ramakrishnas disciple vivekananda in the story hapworth NUM NUM the character of seymour glass describes him as one of the most exciting original and best-equipped giants of this century 
in NUM salinger published a collection of seven stories from the new yorker bananafish among them as well as two that the magazine had rejected 
the collection was published as nine stories in the united states and for esmwith love and squalor in the uk after one of salingers best-known stories 
the book received grudgingly positive reviews and was a financial successremarkably so for a volume of short stories according to hamilton 
nine stories spent three months on the new york times bestseller list 
already tightening his grip on publicity though salinger refused to allow publishers of the collection to depict his characters in dust jacket illustrations lest readers form preconceived notions of them 
as the notoriety of the catcher in the rye grew salinger gradually withdrew from public view 
in NUM he moved from an apartment at
NUM east NUMth street new york to cornish new hampshire 
early in his time at cornish he was relatively sociable particularly with students at windsor high school 
salinger invited them to his house frequently to play records and talk about problems at school 
one such student shirley blaney persuaded salinger to be interviewed for the high school page of the daily eagle the city paper 
nonetheless after blaneys interview appeared prominently in the newspapers editorial section salinger cut off all contact with the high schoolers without explanation 
he was also seen less frequently around town meeting only one close friendjurist learned handwith any regularity 
he also began to publish with less frequency 
after the NUM publication of nine stories he published only four stories through the rest of the decade two in NUM and one each in NUM and NUM
in february NUM at the age of NUM salinger married claire douglas a radcliffe student her father was the art critic robert langton douglas
they had two children margaret b december NUM NUM and matthew b february NUM NUM
margaret salinger wrote in her memoir dream catcher that she believes her parents would not have married nor would she have been born had her father not read the teachings of lahiri mahasaya a guru of paramahansa yogananda which brought the possibility of enlightenment to those following the path of the householder a married person with children
after their marriage salinger and claire were initiated into the path of kriya yoga in a small store-front hindu temple in washington dc  during the summer of NUM
they received a mantra and breathing exercises to practice for ten minutes twice a day 
salinger also insisted that claire drop out of school and live with him only four months shy of graduation which she did 
certain elements of the story franny published in january NUM are based on his relationship with claire including her ownership of the book the way of the pilgrim
because of their isolated location and salingers proclivities they hardly saw other people for long stretches of time 
claire was also frustrated by salingers ever-changing religious beliefs 
though she committed herself to kriya yoga she remembered that salinger would chronically leave cornish to work on a story for several weeks only to return with the piece he was supposed to be finishing all undone or destroyed and some new ism we had to follow 
claire believed it was to cover the fact that jerry had just destroyed or junked or couldnt face the quality of or couldnt face publishing what he had created 
after abandoning kriya yoga salinger tried dianetics the forerunner of scientology even meeting its founder l ron hubbard but according to claire he was quickly disenchanted with it 
this was followed by an adherence to a number of spiritual medical and nutritional belief systems including an interest in christian science edgar cayce homeopathy acupuncture and macrobiotics 
salingers family life was further marked by discord after the first child was born according to margarets book claire felt that her daughter had replaced her in salingers affections 
the infant margaret was sick much of the time but salinger having embraced the tenets of christian science refused to take her to a doctor 
according to margaret her mother admitted to her years later that she went over the edge in the winter of NUM and had made plans to murder her and then commit suicide 
claire had supposedly intended to do it during a trip to new york city with salinger but she instead acted on a sudden impulse to take margaret from the hotel and run away 
after a few months salinger persuaded her to return to cornish 
salinger published franny and zooey in NUM and  in NUM
each book contained two short stories or novellas previously published in the new yorker about members of the glass family 
these four stories were originally published between NUM and NUM and were the only ones salinger had published since nine stories
on the dust jacket of franny and zooey salinger wrote in reference to his interest in privacy it is my rather subversive opinion that a writers feelings of anonymity-obscurity are the second most valuable property on loan to him during his working years 
on september NUM NUM time magazine devoted its cover to salinger 
in an article that profiled his life of recluse the magazine reported that the glass family series is nowhere near completion .. salinger intends to write a glass trilogy 
nonetheless salinger published only one other story after that hapworth NUM NUM a novella in the form of a long letter from seven-year-old seymour glass while at summer camp 
his first new work in six years the novella took up most of the june NUM NUM issue of the new yorker and was universally panned by critics 
around this time salinger had isolated claire from friends and relatives and made herin the words of margaret salingera virtual prisoner
claire separated from him in september NUM their divorce was finalized on october NUM NUM
in NUM at the age of NUM salinger had a relationship with NUM-year-old joyce maynard that lasted for nine months 
maynard at this time was already an experienced writer for seventeen magazine 
the new york times had asked maynard to write an article for them which when published as an eighteen-year-old looks back on life on april NUM NUM made her a celebrity 
salinger wrote a letter to her warning about living with fame 
after exchanging NUM letters maynard moved in with salinger the summer after her freshman year at yale university 
maynard did not return to yale that fall and spent ten months as a guest in salingers cornish home 
the relationship ended he told his daughter margaret at a family outing because maynard wanted children and he felt he was too old 
nevertheless in her own autobiography maynard paints a different picture saying salinger abruptly ended the relationship and refused to take her back 
she had dropped out of yale to be with him even forgoing a scholarship 
maynard later writes in her own memoir how she came to find out that salinger had begun relationships with young women by exchanging letters 
one of those letter recipients included salingers last wife a nurse who was already engaged to be married to someone else when she met the author 
while he was living with maynard salinger continued to write in a disciplined fashion a few hours every morning 
according to maynard by NUM he had completed two new novels 
in a rare NUM interview with the new york times he explained there is a marvelous peace in not publishing .
i like to write 
i love to write 
but i write just for myself and my own pleasure 
according to maynard he saw publication as a damned interruption
in her memoir margaret salinger describes the detailed filing system her father had for his unpublished manuscripts a red mark meant if i die before i finish my work publish this as is blue meant publish but edit first and so on 
a neighbor said that salinger told him that he had written NUM unpublished novels 
salingers final interview was in june NUM with betty eppes of the baton rouge advocate which has been represented somewhat differently depending on the secondary source 
by one account eppes was an attractive young woman who misrepresented herself as an aspiring novelist and managed to record audio of the interview as well as take several photographs of salinger both without his knowledge or consent 
in a separate account emphasis is placed on her contact by letter writing from the local post office and salingers personal initiative to cross the bridge to meet with the woman who in the course of the interview made clear she was a reporter and who did indeed at the close take pictures of salinger as he departed
according to the first account the interview ended disastrously when a local passer-by from cornish attempted to shake the famous authors hand at which point salinger became enraged 
a further account of the interview published later in the paris review purportedly by eppes as author has been disowned by eppes and separately ascribed as a derived work of review editor george plimpton 
although salinger tried to escape public exposure as much as possible he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both the media and the public 
readers of his work and students from nearby dartmouth college often came to cornish in groups hoping to catch a glimpse of him 
in may NUM salinger learned that the british writer ian hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters salinger had written to other authors and friends 
salinger sued to stop the books publication 
the court in salinger v random house ruled that hamiltons extensive use of the letters including quotation and paraphrasing was not acceptable since the authors right to control publication overrode the right of fair use 
the book was not published 
later hamilton published in search of jd 
salinger a writing life NUM but this book was more about his experience in tracking down information and the copyright fights over the planned biography than about salinger himself 
an unintended consequence of the lawsuit was that many details of salingers private life including that he had spent the last twenty years writing in his words just a work of fiction .. thats all became public in the form of court transcripts 
excerpts from his letters were also widely disseminated most notably a bitter remark written in response to oona oneills marriage to charlie chaplin
salinger was romantically involved with television actress elaine joyce for several years in the NUMs 
the relationship ended when he met colleen oneill b june NUM NUM a nurse and quiltmaker whom he married around NUM
oneill forty years his junior once told margaret salinger that she and salinger were trying to have a child 
in NUM iranian director dariush mehrjui released the film pari an unauthorized and loose adaptation of salingers franny and zooey
though the film could be distributed legally in iran since the country has no official copyright relations with the united states salinger had his lawyers block a planned screening of the film at the lincoln center in NUM
mehrjui called salingers action bewildering explaining that he saw his film as a kind of cultural exchange
in NUM salinger gave a small publisher orchises press permission to publish hapworth NUM NUM the previously uncollected novella 
it was to be published that year and listings for it appeared at amazoncom and other book-sellers 
after a flurry of articles and critical reviews of the story appeared in the press the publication date was pushed back repeatedly before apparently being cancelled altogether 
amazon anticipated that orchises would publish the story in january NUM but at the time of his death it was still listed as currently unavailable
in june NUM salinger consulted lawyers about the upcoming publication in the us of an unauthorized sequel to the catcher in the rye written by swedish book publisher fredrik colting under the pseudonym j 
d california
californias book is called  and appears to pick up the story of salingers protagonist holden caulfield 
in salingers novel caulfield is NUM years old wandering the streets of new york after being expelled from his private school the california book features a NUM-year-old man mr c musing on having escaped his nursing home 
salingers new york literary agent phyllis westberg told britains sunday telegraph the matter has been turned over to a lawyer
the fact that little was known about colting and the book was set to be published by a new publishing imprint called windupbird publishing gave rise to speculation in literary circles that the whole thing might be a stunt 
district court judge deborah a batts issued an injunction which prevents the book from being published within the us 
the books author filed an appeal on july NUM NUM it was heard in the second circuit court of appeals on september NUM NUM
the case was settled in NUM when colting agreed not to publish or otherwise distribute the book e-book or any other editions of NUM years later in the us or canada until the catcher in the rye enters the public domain while also refraining from using the title coming through the rye dedicating the book to salinger or referring to the title the catcher in the rye while colting remains free to sell the book in other international territories without fear of interference 
on october NUM NUM the new york times reported not even a fire that consumed at least half his home on tuesday could smoke out the reclusive j d salinger author of the classic novel of adolescent rebellion the catcher in the rye
mr salinger is almost equally famous for having elevated privacy to an art form 
in NUM NUM years after the end of their relationship joyce maynard auctioned a series of letters salinger had written her 
maynards memoir of her life and her relationship with salinger at home in the world a memoir was published the same year 
among other topics the book described how maynards mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author who was dressing like a child and described joyces relationship with him at length 
in the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons she would have preferred to donate them to the beinecke library 
software developer peter norton bought the letters for usNUM and announced his intention to return them to salinger 
a year later salingers daughter margaret by his second wife claire douglas published 
in her book she described the harrowing control that salinger had over her mother and dispelled many of the salinger myths established by ian hamiltons book 
one of hamiltons arguments was that salingers experience with post-traumatic stress disorder left him psychologically scarred and that he was unable to deal with the traumatic nature of his war service 
salinger allowed that the few men who lived through bloody mortain a battle in which her father fought were left with much to sicken them body and soul but she also painted a picture of her father as a man immensely proud of his service record maintaining his military haircut and service jacket and moving about his compound and town in an old jeep 
both margaret salinger and maynard characterized the author as a devoted film buff 
according to margaret his favorite movies include gigi NUM the lady vanishes NUM the NUM steps NUM phoebes favorite movie in the catcher in the rye and the comedies of wc fields laurel and hardy and the marx bros . predating vcrs salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the NUMs in NUMmm prints 
maynard wrote that he loves movies not films and salinger argued that her fathers worldview is essentially a product of the movies of his day 
to my father all spanish speakers are puerto rican washerwomen or the toothless grinning-gypsy types in a marx brothers movie
lillian ross a staff writer for the new yorker and longtime friend of salingers wrote following his death salinger loved movies and he was more fun than anyone to discuss them with 
he enjoyed watching actors work and he enjoyed knowing them 
he loved anne bancroft hated audrey hepburn and said that he had seen grand illusion ten times 
margaret also offered many insights into other salinger myths including her fathers supposed long-time interest in macrobiotics and involvement with alternative medicine and eastern philosophies 
a few weeks after dream catcher was published margarets brother matt discredited the memoir in a letter to the new york observer
he disparaged his sisters gothic tales of our supposed childhood and stated i cant say with any authority that she is consciously making anything up 
i just know that i grew up in a very different house with two very different parents from those my sister describes 
salinger died of natural causes at his home in new hampshire on january NUM NUM
he was NUM
salingers literary representative told the new york times that the writer had broken his hip in may NUM but that his health had been excellent until a rather sudden decline after the new year 
the representative believed that salingers death was not a painful one 
his third wife and widow colleen oneill zakrzeski salinger and salingers son matt became the executors of his estate 
in a contributors note salinger gave to harpers magazine in NUM he wrote i almost always write about very young people a statement that has been referred to as his credo 
adolescents are featured or appear in all of salingers work from his first published short story the young folks NUM to the catcher in the rye and his glass family stories 
in NUM the critic alfred kazin explained that salingers choice of teenagers as a subject matter was one reason for his appeal to young readers but another was a consciousness among youths that he speaks for them and virtually to them in a language that is peculiarly honest and their own with a vision of things that capture their most secret judgments of the world 
for this reason norman mailer once remarked that salinger was the greatest mind ever to stay in prep school
salingers language especially his energetic realistically sparse dialogue was revolutionary at the time his first stories were published and was seen by several critics as the most distinguishing thing about his work 
salinger identified closely with his characters and used techniques such as interior monologue letters and extended telephone calls to display his gift for dialogue 
such style elements also gave him the illusion of having as it were delivered his characters destinies into their own keeping 
recurring themes in salingers stories also connect to the ideas of innocence and adolescence including the corrupting influence of hollywood and the world at large the disconnect between teenagers and phony adults and the perceptive precocious intelligence of children 
contemporary critics discuss a clear progression over the course of salingers published work as evidenced by the increasingly negative reviews received by each of his three post-catcher story collections 
ian hamilton adheres to this view arguing that while salingers early stories for the slicks boasted tight energetic dialogue they had also been formulaic and sentimental 
it took the standards of the new yorker editors among them william shawn to refine his writing into the spare teasingly mysterious withheld qualities of a perfect day for bananafish NUM the catcher in the rye and his stories of the early NUMs 
by the late NUMs as salinger became more reclusive and involved in religious study hamilton notes that his stories became longer less plot-driven and increasingly filled with digression and parenthetical remarks 
louis menand agrees writing in the new yorker that salinger stopped writing stories in the conventional sense .
he seemed to lose interest in fiction as an art formperhaps he thought there was something manipulative or inauthentic about literary device and authorial control 
in recent years some critics have defended certain post-nine stories works by salinger in NUM janet malcolm wrote in the new york review of books that zooey is arguably salingers masterpiece .. rereading it and its companion piece franny is no less rewarding than rereading the great gatsby.
salingers writing has influenced several prominent writers prompting harold brodkey himself an o henry award-winning author to state in NUM his is the most influential body of work in english prose by anyone since hemingway 
of the writers in salingers generation pulitzer prize-winning novelist john updike attested that the short stories of j d salinger really opened my eyes as to how you can weave fiction out of a set of events that seem almost unconnected or very lightly connected .. reading salinger sticks in my mind as really having moved me a step up as it were toward knowing how to handle my own material 
the critic louis menand has observed that the early stories of pulitzer prize-winner philip roth were affected by salingers voice and comic timing
national book award finalist richard yates told the new york times in NUM that reading salingers stories for the first time was a landmark experience and that nothing quite like it has happened to me since
yates describes salinger as a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled and who knew exactly what he was doing in every silence as well as in every word 
gordon lishs o henry award-winning short story for jeromwith love and kisses NUM collected in what i know so far NUM is a play on salingers for esmwith love and squalor
in NUM louis menand wrote in the new yorker that catcher in the rye rewrites among each new generation had become a literary genre all its own
he classed among them sylvia plaths the bell jar NUM hunter s thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas NUM jay mcinerneys bright lights big city NUM and dave eggerss a heartbreaking work of staggering genius NUM
writer aimee bender was struggling with her first short stories when a friend gave her a copy of nine stories inspired she later described salingers effect on writers explaining it feels like salinger wrote the catcher in the rye in a day and that incredible feeling of ease inspires writing 
inspires the pursuit of voice 
not his voice 
my voice 
your voice 
authors such as stephen chbosky jonathan safran foer carl hiaasen susan minot haruki murakami gwendoline riley tom robbins louis sachar joel stein and john green have cited salinger as an influence 
musician tomas kalnoky of streetlight manifesto also cites salinger as an influence referencing him and holden caulfield the main character of catcher in the rye in the song heres to life
biographer paul alexander called salinger the greta garbo of literature
in the mid-NUMs j d salinger was himself drawn to sufi mysticism through the writer and thinker idries shahs seminal work the sufis as were others writers such as doris lessing and geoffrey grigson and the poets robert graves and ted hughes 
as well as idries shah salinger also read the taoist philosopher lao tse and the hindu swami vivekananda who introduced the indian philosophies of vedanta and yoga to the western world 
in an oral biography titled salinger authors david shields and shane salerno assert that the author had left specific instructions authorizing a timetable to start between NUM and NUM for the release of several unpublished works 
according to the authors and their sources these include five new glass-family stories a novel based on salingers relationship with his first wife sylvia a novella in the form of a world war ii counterintelligence officers diary a manual of stories about vedanta and other new or retooled stories that illuminate the life of holden caulfield 
the salinger biography is also described as a companion volume to a film documentary of the same title 
the directorial debut of writer shane salerno salinger was made over nine years and received a limited theatrical release on september NUM NUM
fiction

fiction is a story or setting that is derived from imaginationin other words not based strictly on history or fact 
fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats including writings live performances films television programs animations video games and role-playing games though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature see literary fiction including novels novellas short stories and plays 
fiction is occasionally used in its narrowest sense to mean simply any literary narrative
a work of fiction is an act of creative imagination so its total faithfulness to the real-world is not typically assumed by its audience 
therefore fiction is not commonly expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually accurate 
instead the context of fiction not adhering precisely to the real world is generally understood as being more open to interpretation 
characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe an independent fictional universe 
fiction is regarded as the traditional opposite of non-fiction whose creators assume responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth however the distinction between fiction and non-fiction can be unclear for example in postmodern literature 
traditionally fiction includes novels short stories fables legends myths fairy tales epic and narrative poetry plays including operas musicals dramas puppet plays and various kinds of theatrical dances
however fiction may also encompass comic books and many animated cartoons stop motions anime manga films video games radio programs television programs comedies and dramas etc 
the internet has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction calling into question the feasibility of copyright as a means to ensure royalties are paid to copyright holders 
also digital libraries such as project gutenberg make public domain texts more readily available 
the combination of inexpensive home computers the internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction such as interactive computer games or computer-generated comics 
countless forums for fan fiction can be found online where loyal followers of specific fictional realms create and distribute derivative stories 
the internet is also used for the development of blog fiction where a story is delivered through a blog either as flash fiction or serial blog and collaborative fiction where a story is written sequentially by different authors or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a wiki 
types of literary fiction in prose include


fiction is commonly broken down into a variety of genres subsets of fiction each differentiated by a particular unifying tone or style narrative technique media content or popularly defined criterion 
science fiction for example predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the works creation jules vernes novel from the earth to the moon was published in NUM and only in NUM did astronaut neil armstrong first land on the moon 
historical fiction places imaginary characters into real historical events 
in the early historical novel waverley sir walter scotts fictional character edward waverley meets a figure from history bonnie prince charlie and takes part in the battle of prestonpans 
some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story or a reconstructed biography 
often even when the fictional story is based on fact there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting 
an example is tim obriens the things they carried a series of short stories about the vietnam war 
fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural magical or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of fantasy including lewis carrolls alice in wonderland j k rowlings harry potter series and j r r tolkiens the lord of the rings
creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies 
literary fiction is defined as fictional works that are deemed to be of literary merit as distinguished from most commercial or genre fiction 
the distinction can be controversial among critics and scholars 
neal stephenson has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction 
on the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage with employment at a university or a similar institution and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics 
on the other hand he suggests genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales 
however in an interview john updike lamented that the category of literary fiction has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books and if anybody wanted to read them terrific the more the merrier 
..
im a genre writer of a sort 
i write literary fiction which is like spy fiction or chick lit
likewise on the charlie rose show he argued that this term when applied to his work greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing so he does not really like it 
he suggested that all his works are literary simply because they are written in words
literary fiction often involves social commentary political criticism or reflection on the human condition 
in general it focuses on introspective in-depth character studies of interesting complex and developed characters 
this contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern 
usually in literary fiction the focus is on the inner story of the characters who drive the plot with detailed motivations to elicit emotional involvement in the reader 
the style of literary fiction is often described as elegantly written lyrical and  .. layered
the tone of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction 
as terrence rafferty notes literary fiction by its nature allows itself to dawdle to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way
realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic setting time and location in the world is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case often being set in an entirely imaginary universe an alternative history of the world other than that currently understood as true or some other non-existent location or time-period sometimes even presenting impossible technology or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature 
however all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas issues or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality though still distinct from it 
in terms of the traditional separation between fiction and non-fiction the lines are now commonly understood as blurred showing more overlap than mutual exclusion 
even fiction usually has elements of or grounding in truth 
the distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people places and events are all historically or factually real while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas 
the distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding on the one hand that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions while on the other hand imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality 
literary critic james wood argues that fiction is both artifice and verisimilitude meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability a notion often encapsulated in poet samuel taylor coleridges term willing suspension of disbelief 
also infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality 
culture of the united states

the culture of the united states of america is primarily of western culture european origin and form but is influenced by a multicultural ethos that includes african native american asian polynesian and latin american people and their cultures 
it also has its own social and cultural characteristics such as dialect music arts social habits cuisine and folklore 
the united states of america is an ethnically and racially diverse country as a result of large-scale migration from many countries throughout its history 
many american cultural elements especially from popular culture have spread across the globe through modern mass media 
the european roots of the united states are in the english settlers of colonial america during british rule 
the varieties of english people as opposed to the other peoples in the british isles were the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the NUMth century population of the colonies in NUM NUM and were NUM.NUM of percent of the total population of NUM
NUM million 
they constituted NUM of the whites at the first census in NUM  NUM.NUM welsh NUM.NUM scotch irish NUM.NUM scots NUM.NUM southern irish NUM.NUM german NUM.NUM dutch NUM.NUM french and  NUM swedish the american revolution colin bonwick NUM p NUM
the english ethnic group contributed the major cultural and social mindset and attitudes that evolved into the american character 
of the total population in each colony they numbered from NUM in pennsylvania to NUM in massachusetts becoming america jon butler NUM pp 
NUM-NUM
large non-english immigrant populations from the NUMs to NUM such as the germans NUM or more scotch irish NUM added enriched and modified the english cultural substrate the encyclopedia of colonial and revolutionary america ed 
john mack faragher NUM pp 
NUM-NUM
the religious outlook was some versions of protestantism NUM.NUM of the population were english german and irish catholics 
the british colonies inherited the english language legal system and british culture which was the majority cultural heritage 
parts of what are now the united states were colonized by france spain the netherlands sweden denmark russia and japan northern mariana islands and briefly guam
though eventually overtaken by british or american territorial expansion the longer they lasted the more these earlier colonial societies contributed to modern-day culture including place names architecture religion language and food 
jeffersonian democracy was a foundational american cultural innovation which is still a core part of the countrys identity 
thomas jeffersons notes on the state of virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an american and was written in reaction to the views of some influential europeans that americas native flora fauna including humans were degenerate 
major cultural influences have been brought by historical immigration especially from germany in much of the country ireland and italy in the northeast japan in hawaii 
latin american culture is especially pronounced in former spanish areas but has also been introduced by immigration as has asian american cultures especially on the west coast
forced migration during the atlantic slave trade followed by liberation won in the american civil war created african-american culture which pervades the south and other areas receiving internal immigrants during the great migrations 
blending southern and traditional african culture to some degree this uniquely american culture has its own dialect has contributed significant innovation in music dance and fashion embraced a struggle by many african-americans for political and economic equality and is associated with significant populations of african-american muslims and christians in black churches
rap and music videos featuring african-american urban street culture have appeared in countries and melded with local performance cultures worldwide 
though many mainland native american tribes and nations were overpowered by european colonists and american territorial expansion but even in the areas they were pushed out of left cultural influences such as place names knowledge about new world crops cultural appropriation and the history military rivalry resulted in native american-themed sports mascots 
native culture remains strong in areas with large undisturbed or relocated populations including traditional government and communal organization of property now legally managed by indian reservations large reservations are mostly in the west especially arizona and south dakota
the fate of native culture after contact with europeans is quite varied 
for example tano culture in us caribbean territories is nearly extinct and like most native american languages the tano language is no longer spoken 
in contrast the hawaiian language and culture of the native hawaiians has survived in hawaii and mixed with that of immigrants from the mainland us starting before the NUM annexation and to some degree japanese immigrants 
it occasionally influences mainstream american culture with notable exports like surfing and hawaiian shirts 
most languages native to what is now us territory have gone extinct and the economic and mainstream cultural dominance of english threatens the surviving ones in most places 
the most common native languages include samoan hawaiian navajo language cherokee sioux and a spectrum of inuit languages 
see indigenous languages of the americas for a fuller listing plus chamorro and carolinian in the pacific territories 
ethnic samoans are a majority in american samoa chamorro are still the largest ethnic group in guam though a minority and along with refaluwasch are smaller minorities in the northern mariana islands 
american culture includes both conservative and liberal elements scientific and religious competitiveness political structures risk taking and free expression materialist and moral elements 
despite certain consistent ideological principles eg 
individualism egalitarianism and faith in freedom and democracy american culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity 
the flexibility of us culture and its highly symbolic nature lead some researchers to categorize american culture as a mythic identity others see it as american exceptionalism 
the united states has traditionally been thought of as a melting pot with immigrants contributing to but eventually assimiliating with mainstream american culture 
however beginning in the NUMs and continuing on in the present day the country trends towards cultural diversity pluralism and the image of a salad bowl instead 
throughout the countrys history certain subcultures whether based on ethnicity or other commonality such as the gay village have dominated certain neighborhoods only partially melded with the broader culture 
due to the extent of american culture there are many integrated but unique social subcultures within the united states some not tied to any particular geography 
the cultural affiliations an individual in the united states may have commonly depend on social class political orientation and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background occupation and ethnic group membership 
mass media promote cross-cultural diffusion 
some subcultures have national media exposure with dedicated television channels and crossover with mainstream media such as latin african american and lgbt culture though there are many niche channels
some communities have local broadcast or paper publications that carry content from a specific culture such as native radio stations or chinese-language newspapers in chinatowns 
almost every subculture has a presence on the world wide web and social media 
military history has influenced american culture and its worldwide reach in several ways 
german cuisine became stigmatized by world war i but in contrast the end of world war ii resulted in cross-fertilization of american and japanese business techniques during reconstruction and occupation and brought home troops with an increased taste for italian dishes 
wars have also forced progress on equal rights for women and racial minorities as these groups proved their till-then unrealized potential either in industry while men were off fighting or by serving in the military honorably and effectively 
the american civil war highlighted differences in culture including attitudes toward racism between the southern united states and the north 
though the issue of slavery was settled by the war racism and discrimination persisted and were supported by laws in some southern states 
combined with determined civil rights activism later wars resulted in profound changes in social norms including desegregation more intermixing of black and white cultures and more egalitarian social roles for men and women compared to countries that have not undergone similar shifts 
modern display of the confederate flag and removal of confederate monuments and memorials remain controversial cultural and political issues though many elements of proud southern identity and culture such as hospitality drawl and comfort food have nothing to do with racial division 
some differences in modern cultural tendencies fall along liberal-conservative political lines with people on both sides of that increasingly self-segregating 
the post-wwii economic and military power of the united states not to mention its large relatively unified population also helped it become more of an exporter of its own culture and values compared to its initial tendency to import of european culture especially in its early largely rural decades
the united states has also administered now-foreign territories for many years creating opportunities for cultural intermingling among many government employees and military personnel 
the longest stays have included the philippines NUM panama canal zone NUM haiti NUM-NUM the dominican republic NUM-NUM and various japanese islands and the trust territory of the pacific islands for decades after wwii 
colonists from the united states formed the now-independent country of liberia which inherited a considerable amount of american culture and values 
given its proximity relatively free movement over the border the highly integrated north american economy strong military alliance shared origins in british colonialism and a common language the english-speaking culture of canada is strongly influenced by that of the united states 
some canadian resist the dominance of the united states includes requirements for domestically produced mass media though especially since the hollywood north phenomenon began in the NUMs canada also exports entertainment to the united states 
american movies may have made the biggest impact of all american exports on popular culture worldwide 
semi-distinct cultural regions of the united states include new england the mid-atlantic states the southern united states the midwestern united states and the western united statesan area that can be further subdivided on the basis of the local culture into the pacific states and the mountain states 
the western coast of the continental united states consisting of california oregon and the state of washington is also sometimes referred to as the left coast indicating its left-leaning political orientation and tendency towards social liberalism 
southern united states are informally called the bible belt due to socially conservative evangelical protestantism which is a significant part of the regions culture and christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher there than the nations average 
this region is usually contrasted with the mainline protestantism and catholicism of the northeastern united states the religiously diverse midwest and great lakes the mormon corridor in utah and southern idaho and the relatively secular western united states 
the percentage of non-religious people is the highest in the northeastern state of vermont at NUM compared to the bible belt state of alabama where it is NUM
strong cultural differences have a long history in the us with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example 
not only social but also economic tensions between the northern and southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the south to declare itself an independent nation the confederate states of america thus initiating the american civil war 
david hackett fischer theorizes that the united states is made up today of four distinct regional cultures 
the books focus is on the folkways of four groups of settlers from the british isles that emigrated from distinct regions of britain and ireland to the british american colonies during the NUMth and NUMth centuries 
fischers thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted albeit with some modification over time providing the basis for the four modern regional cultures of the united states 
according to fischer the foundation of american culture was formed from four mass migrations from four different regions of the british isles by four distinct socio-religious groups 
new englands earliest settlement period occurred between NUM and NUM when puritans mostly from east anglia in england settled there forming the new england regional culture 
the next mass migration was of southern english cavaliers and their working class english domestic servants to the chesapeake bay region between NUM and NUM
this facilitated the development of the southern american culture 
then between NUM and NUM thousands of english and welsh quakers led by william penn settled in the delaware valley followed by large numbers of german lutherans 
this settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the general american culture although according to fischer it is really just a regional american culture even if it does today encompass most of the us from the mid-atlantic states to the pacific coast 
finally scotch-irish english and scottish settlers from the borderlands of britain and ireland migrated to appalachia between NUM and NUM
they formed the regional culture of the upland south which has since spread west to such areas as west texas and parts of the us southwest 
fischer suggests that the us today is not a country with one general american culture and three or more regional sub-cultures 
he asserts that the country is composed of just regional cultures and that understanding that helps one to understand many things about modern american life 
fischer also makes the point that the development of these regional cultures derived not only from where exactly the settlers first came but when they came 
fischer asserts that during different periods of time a population of people will have very distinct beliefs fears hopes and prejudices and that various groups of settlers brought these feelings to the new world where they more or less froze in time in america even if they eventually changed in their place of origin 
continuing the work of fischer colin woodard in his book american nations claims an existence of eleven rival regional cultures in north america based on the cultural characteristics of the original settlers of these regions 
these regions are yankeedom new netherland the midlands tidewater greater appalachia the deep south new france el norte the left coast the far west and first nation a region in parts of northern canada and alaska and greenland
according to woodard these regions cross and disregard formal state or even country borders 
for example he compares the mexican border with the berlin wall saying that el norte in some ways resembles germany during the cold war two peoples with a common culture separated by a large wall 
although the united states has no official language at the federal level NUM states have passed legislation making english the official language and it is considered to be the de facto national language 
according to the NUM us census more than NUM of americans can speak english well and for NUM it is the only language spoken at home 
more than NUM languages besides english have native speakers in the united statessome of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples about NUM living languages and others imported by immigrants 
spanish has official status in the commonwealth of puerto rico and the state of new mexico spanish is the primary spoken language in puerto rico and various smaller linguistic enclaves 
according to the NUM census there are nearly NUM million native speakers of spanish in the united states 
bilingual speakers may use both english and spanish reasonably well but code-switch according to their dialog partner or context 
some refer to this phenomenon as spanglish 
indigenous languages of the united states include the native american languages which are spoken on the countrys numerous indian reservations and native american cultural events such as pow wows hawaiian which has official status in the state of hawaii chamorro which has official status in the commonwealths of guam and the northern mariana islands carolinian which has official status in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands and samoan which has official status in the commonwealth of american samoa 
american sign language used mainly by the deaf is also native to the country 
the national dialect is known as american english which itself consists of numerous regional dialects but has some shared unifying features that distinguish it from other national varieties of english 
there are four large dialect regions in the united statesthe north the midland the south and the westand several smaller dialect regions such as those of new york city philadelphia and boston 
a standard dialect called general american analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere in the english-speaking world lacking the distinctive noticeable features of any particular region is believed by some to exist as well it is sometimes regionally associated with the vaguely-defined midwest
the following information is an estimation as actual statistics constantly vary 
according to the cia the following is the percentage of total populations native languages in the united states

the right to freedom of expression in the american constitution can be traced to german immigrant john peter zenger and his legal fight to make truthful publications in the colonies a protected legal right ultimately paving the way for the protected rights of american authors 
in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries american art and literature took most of its cues from europe 
during its early history america was a series of british colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day united states 
therefore its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of english literature 
however unique american characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition 
americas first internationally popular writers were james fenimore cooper and washington irving in the early nineteenth century 
they painted an american literary landscape full of humor and adventure 
these were followed by nathaniel hawthorne edgar allan poe herman melville ralph waldo emerson henry wadsworth longfellow and henry david thoreau who established a distinctive american literary voice in the middle of the nineteenth century 
mark twain henry james and poet walt whitman were major figures in the centurys second half emily dickinson virtually unknown during her lifetime would be recognized as americas other essential poet 
eleven us citizens have won the nobel prize in literature including john steinbeck william faulkner eugene oneill pearl s buck t s eliot and sinclair lewis 
ernest hemingway the NUM nobel laureate is often named as one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century 
a work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and charactersuch as herman melvilles moby-dick NUM twains the adventures of huckleberry finn NUM and f scott fitzgeralds the great gatsby NUMmay be dubbed the great american novel
popular literary genres such as the western and hardboiled crime fiction were developed in the united states 
in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries american artists primarily painted landscapes and portraits in a realistic style 
a parallel development taking shape in rural america was the american craft movement which began as a reaction to the industrial revolution 
developments in modern art in europe came to america from exhibitions in new york city such as the armory show in NUM
after world war ii new york emerged as a center of the art world 
painting in the united states today covers a vast range of styles 
american painting includes works by jackson pollock john singer sargent and norman rockwell among many others 
architecture in the united states is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces not only english 
us architecture can therefore be said to be eclectic something unsurprising in such a multicultural society 
in the absence of a single large-scale architectural influence from indigenous peoples such as those in mexico or peru generations of designers have incorporated influences from around the world 
currently the overriding theme of american architecture is modernity as manifest in the skyscrapers of the NUMth century 
early neoclassicism accompanied the founding fathers idealization of european enlightenment making it the predominant architectural style for public buildings and large manors 
however in recent years suburbanization and mass migration to the sun belt has allowed architecture to reflect a mediterranean style as well 
theater of the united states is based in the western tradition and did not take on a unique dramatic identity until the emergence of eugene oneill in the early twentieth century now considered by many to be the father of american drama 
oneill is a four-time winner of the pulitzer prize for drama and the only american playwright to win the nobel prize for literature 
after oneill american drama came of age and flourished with the likes of arthur miller tennessee williams lillian hellman william inge and clifford odets during the first half of the twentieth century 
after this fertile period american theater broke new ground artistically with the absurdist forms of edward albee in the NUMs 
social commentary has also been a preoccupation of american theater often addressing issues not discussed in the mainstream 
writers such as lorraine hansbury august wilson david mamet and tony kushner have all won pulitzer prizes for their polemical plays on american society 
the united states is also the home and largest exporter of modern musical theater producing such musical talents as rodgers and hammerstein lerner and loewe cole porter irving berlin leonard bernstein george and ira gershwin kander and ebb and stephen sondheim 
broadway is one of the largest theater communities in the world and is the epicenter of american commercial theater 
american music styles and influences such as rock and roll jazz rock techno soul country hip-hop blues and music based on them can be heard all over the world 
music in the us is diverse 
it includes african-american influence in the NUMth century 
the first half of this century is famous for jazz introduced by african-americans 
in the NUMs NUMs NUMs and NUMs rock and pop music was prevalent 
the united states is represented by various genres of dance from ballet to hip-hop and folk 
the cinema of the united states often generally referred to as hollywood has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early twentieth century 
while the lumiere brothers are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema it is american cinema that has emerged as the most dominant force in the industry 
its history can be separated into four main periods the silent film era classical hollywood cinema new hollywood and the contemporary period 
actor james dean who appeared in films during the classical hollywood era until his untimely death is widely regarded as an american cultural icon of teenage disillusionment 
american independent cinema was revitalized in the late NUMs and early NUMs when another new generation of moviemakers including spike lee steven soderbergh kevin smith and quentin tarantino made movies like respectively do the right thing sex lies and videotape clerks and reservoir dogs
in terms of directing screenwriting editing and other elements these movies were innovative and often irreverent playing with and contradicting the conventions of hollywood movies 
furthermore their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film 
since then the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in american cinema 
many of the major studios have capitalized on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films for example fox searchlight pictures 
to a lesser degree in the early NUMst century film types that were previously considered to have only a minor presence in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent american box office draws 
these include foreign-language films such as crouching tiger hidden dragon baahubali NUM and hero and documentary films such as super size me march of the penguins and michael moores bowling for columbine and fahrenheit NUM
television is a major mass media of the united states 
household ownership of television sets in the country is NUM.NUM and the majority of households have more than one set 
the peak ownership percentage of households with at least one television set occurred during the NUM season with NUM.NUM ownership 
as a whole the television networks of the united states are the largest and most syndicated in the world 
as of august NUM approximately NUM american households own at least one television set 
due to a recent surge in the number and popularity of critically acclaimed television series many critics have said that american television is currently enjoying a golden age 
there is a regard for scientific advancement and technological innovation in american culture resulting in the flow of many modern innovations 
the great american inventors include robert fulton the steamboat samuel morse the telegraph eli whitney the cotton gin interchangeable parts cyrus mccormick the reaper and thomas edison with more than a thousand inventions credited to his name
most of the new technological innovations over the NUMth and NUMst centuries were either first invented in the united states first widely adopted by americans or both 
examples include the lightbulb the airplane the transistor the atomic bomb nuclear power the personal computer the ipod video games online shopping and the development of the internet 
this propensity for application of scientific ideas continued throughout the NUMth century with innovations that held strong international benefits 
the twentieth century saw the arrival of the space age the information age and a renaissance in the health sciences 
this culminated in cultural milestones such as the apollo moon landings the creation of the personal computer and the sequencing effort called the human genome project 
throughout its history american culture has made significant gains through the open immigration of accomplished scientists 
accomplished scientists include scottish-american scientist alexander graham bell who developed and patented the telephone and other devices german scientist charles steinmetz who developed new alternating-current electrical systems in NUM russian scientist vladimir zworykin who invented the motion camera in NUM serb scientist nikola tesla who patented a brushless electrical induction motor based on rotating magnetic fields in NUM
with the rise of the nazi party in germany a large number of jewish scientists fled germany and immigrated to the country including theoretical physicist albert einstein in NUM
in the years during and following wwii several innovative scientists immigrated to the us from europe such as enrico fermi who came from italy in NUM and led the work that produced the worlds first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction 
post-war europe saw many of its scientists such as rocket scientist wernher von braun recruited by the united states as part of operation paperclip 
education in the united states is and has historically been provided mainly by government 
control and funding come from three levels federal state and local 
school attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels often known outside the united states as the primary and secondary levels
students have the options of having their education held in public schools private schools or home school 
in most public and private schools education is divided into three levels elementary school junior high school also often called middle school and high school 
in almost all schools at these levels children are divided by age groups into grades 
post-secondary education better known as college in the united states is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system 
in the year NUM there were NUM.NUMmillion students enrolled in schools from kindergarten through graduate schools 
of these NUM percent aged NUM to NUM were judged academically on track for their age enrolled in school at or above grade level
of those enrolled in compulsory education NUM.NUMmillion NUM.NUM percent were attending private schools 
among the countrys adult population over NUM percent have completed high school and NUM percent have received a bachelors degree or higher 
among developed countries the us is one of the most religious in terms of its demographics 
according to a NUM study by the pew global attitudes project the us was the only developed nation in the survey where a majority of citizens reported that religion played a very important role in their lives an opinion similar to that found in latin america 
today governments at the national state and local levels are a secular institution with what is often called the separation of church and state
although participation in organized religion has been diminishing the public life and popular culture of the united states incorporates many christian ideals specifically about redemption salvation conscience and morality 
examples are popular culture obsessions with confession and forgiveness which extends from reality television to twelve-step meetings 
americans expect public figures to confess and have public penitence for any sins or moral wrongdoings they may have caused 
according to salon examples of inadequate public penitence may include the scandals and fallout regarding tiger woods alex rodriguez mel gibson larry craig and lance armstrong 
several of the original thirteen colonies were established by english settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination or persecution pennsylvania was established by quakers maryland by roman catholics and the massachusetts bay colony by puritans 
separatist congregationalists pilgrim fathers founded plymouth colony in NUM
they were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of god 
they and the other protestant groups applied the representative democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in wordly matters 
rhode island connecticut and pennsylvania added religious freedom to their democratic constitutions becoming safe havens for persecuted religious minorities 
the first bible printed in a european language in the colonies was by german immigrant christopher sauer 
nine of the thirteen colonies had official public religions 
by the time of the philadelphia convention of NUM the united states became one of the first countries in the world to codify freedom of religion into law although this originally applied only to the federal government and not to state governments or their political subdivisions 
modeling the provisions concerning religion within the virginia statute for religious freedom the framers of the united states constitution rejected any religious test for office and the first amendment specifically denied the central government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise 
in following decades the animating spirit behind the constitutions establishment clause led to the disestablishment of the official religions within the member states 
the framers were mainly influenced by secular enlightenment ideals but they also considered the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups who did not want to be under the power or influence of a state religion that did not represent them 
thomas jefferson author of the declaration of independence said the priest has been hostile to liberty 
he is always in alliance with the despot 
the following information is an estimation as actual statistics constantly vary 
according to the pew research centers religious landscape survey the following is the percentage of followers of different religions in the united states

the united states observes holidays derived from events in american history christian traditions and national patriarchs 
thanksgiving is the principal traditionally american holiday 
it evolved from the english pilgrims custom of giving thanks for ones welfare 
thanksgiving is generally celebrated as a family reunion with a large afternoon feast 
christmas day celebrating the birth of jesus christ is widely celebrated and a federal holiday though a fair amount of its current cultural importance is due to secular reasons 
european colonization has led to some other christian holidays such as easter and st patricks day to be observed though with varying degrees of religious fidelity 
independence day also known as the fourth of july celebrates the anniversary of the countrys declaration of independence from great britain 
it is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the shooting of fireworks at night 
halloween is thought to have evolved from the ancient celticgaelic festival of samhain which was introduced in the american colonies by irish settlers 
it has become a holiday that is celebrated by children and teens who traditionally dress up in costumes and go door to door trick-or-treating for candy 
it also brings about an emphasis on eerie and frightening urban legends and movies 
additionally mardi gras which evolved from the catholic tradition of carnival is observed in new orleans st louis mobile alabama and numerous other towns 
federally recognized holidays are as follows


the united states has few laws governing given names 
traditionally the right to name your child or yourself as you choose has been upheld by court rulings and is rooted in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution and the free speech clause of the first amendment 
a few restrictions do exist 
restrictions vary by state but most are for the sake of practicality for example limiting the number of characters due to limitations in record keeping software
this freedom along with the cultural diversity in the united states has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends 
creativity has also long been a part of american naming traditions and names have been used to express personality cultural identity and values naming trends vary by race geographic area and socioeconomic status 
african-americans for instance have developed a very distinct naming culture 
both religious names and those inspired by popular culture are common 
fashion in the united states is eclectic and predominantly informal 
while americans diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing particularly those of recent immigrants cowboy hats and boots and leather motorcycle jackets are emblematic of specifically american styles 
blue jeans were popularized as work clothes in the NUMs by merchant levi strauss a german-jewish immigrant in san francisco and adopted by many american teenagers a century later 
they are worn in every state by people of all ages and social classes 
along with mass-marketed informal wear in general blue jeans are arguably one of us cultures primary contributions to global fashion 
though informal dress is more common certain professionals such as bankers and lawyers traditionally dress formally for work and some occasions such as weddings funerals dances and some parties typically call for formal wear 
since NUM american schools focused on gymnastics hygiene training and care and development of the human body 
in the NUMs colleges were encouraged to focus on intramural sports particularly track field and in the late NUMs american football 
physical education was incorporated into primary school curriculums in the NUMth century 
baseball is the oldest of the major american team sports 
professional baseball dates from NUM and had no close rivals in popularity until the NUMs 
though baseball is no longer the most popular sport it is still referred to as the national pastime 
also unlike the professional levels of the other popular spectator sports in the us  major league baseball teams play almost every day 
the major league baseball regular season consists of each of the NUM teams playing NUM games from april to september 
the season ends with the postseason and world series in october 
american football known in the united states as simply football now attracts more television viewers than any other sport and is considered to be the most popular sport in the united states 
the NUM-team national football league nfl is the most popular professional american football league 
the national football league differs from the other three major pro sports leagues in that each of its NUM teams plays one game a week over NUM weeks for a total of NUM games with one bye week for each team 
the nfl season lasts from september to december ending with the playoffs and super bowl in january and february 
its championship game the super bowl has often been the highest rated television show and it has an audience of over NUM million viewers annually 
college football also attracts audiences of millions 
some communities particularly in rural areas place great emphasis on their local high school football team 
american football games usually include cheerleaders and marching bands which aim to raise school spirit and entertain the crowd at halftime 
basketball is another major sport represented professionally by the national basketball association 
it was invented in springfield massachusetts in NUM by canadian-born physical education teacher james naismith 
college basketball is also popular due in large part to the ncaa mens division i basketball tournament in march also known as march madness 
ice hockey is the fourth leading professional team sport 
always a mainstay of great lakes and new england-area culture the sport gained tenuous footholds in regions like the american south since the early NUMs as the national hockey league pursued a policy of expansion 
lacrosse is a team sport of american and canadian native american origin and is the fastest growing sport in the united states 
lacrosse is most popular in the east coast area 
nll and mll are the national box and outdoor lacrosse leagues respectively and have increased their following in recent years 
also many of the top division i college lacrosse teams draw upwards of NUM for a game especially in the mid-atlantic and new england areas 
soccer is very popular as a participation sport particularly among youth and the us national teams are competitive internationally 
a twenty-team professional league major league soccer plays from march to october but its television audience and overall popularity lag behind other american professional sports 
boxing and horse racing were once the most watched individual sports but they have been eclipsed by golf and auto racing particularly nascar 
other popular sports are tennis softball rodeo swimming water polo fencing shooting sports hunting volleyball skiing snowboarding skateboarding ultimate disc golf cycling mma roller derby wrestling weightlifting and rugby 
relative to other parts of the world the united states is unusually competitive in womens sports a fact usually attributed to the title ix antidiscrimination law which requires most american colleges to give equal funding to mens and womens sports 
despite that however womens sports are not nearly as popular among spectators as mens sports 
the united states enjoys a great deal of success both in the summer olympics and winter olympics constantly finishing among the top medal winners 
homecoming is an annual tradition of the united states 
people towns high schools and colleges come together usually in late september or early october to welcome back former residents and alumni 
it is built around a central event such as a banquet a parade and most often a game of american football or on occasion basketball wrestling or ice hockey 
when celebrated by schools the activities vary 
however they usually consist of a football game played on the schools home football field activities for students and alumni a parade featuring the schools marching band and sports teams and the coronation of a homecoming queen 
american high schools commonly field football basketball baseball softball volleyball soccer golf swimming track and field and cross-country teams as well 
the cuisine of the united states is extremely diverse owing to the vastness of the continent the relatively large population NUM of a billion people and the number of native and immigrant influences 
mainstream american culinary arts are similar to those in other western countries 
wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains 
traditional american cuisine uses ingredients such as turkey potatoes sweet potatoes corn squash and maple syrup indigenous foods employed by american indians and early european settlers african slaves and their descendants 
the types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the familys own cultural heritage 
recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin and americanized versions of these cultural foods such as american chinese cuisine tex-mex mexican-american cuisine or italian-american cuisine often eventually appear an example is vietnamese cuisine korean cuisine and thai cuisine 
german cuisine has a profound impact on american cuisine especially mid-western cuisine potatoes noodles roasts stews cakes and other pastries are the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines 
dishes such as the hamburger pot roast baked ham and hot dogs are examples of american dishes derived from german cuisine 
different regions of the united states have their own cuisine and styles of cooking 
the states of louisiana and mississippi for example is known for its cajun and creole cooking 
cajun and creole cooking are influenced by french acadian and haitian cooking although the dishes themselves are original and unique 
examples include crawfish etouffee red beans and rice seafood or chicken gumbo jambalaya and boudin 
italian german hungarian and chinese influences traditional native american caribbean mexican and greek dishes have also diffused into the general american repertoire 
it is not uncommon for a middle-class family from middle america to eat for example restaurant pizza home-made pizza enchiladas con carne chicken paprikas beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week 
soul food mostly the same as food eaten by white southerners developed by southern african slaves and their free descendants is popular around the south and among many african-americans elsewhere 
syncretic cuisines such as louisiana creole cajun pennsylvania dutch and tex-mex are regionally important 
iconic american dishes such as apple pie fried chicken pizza hamburgers and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations 
french fries mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos and pasta dishes freely adapted from italian sources are consumed 
americans generally prefer coffee to tea and more than half the adult population drinks at least one cup a day 
marketing by us industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk now often fat-reduced ubiquitous breakfast beverages 
during the NUMs and NUMs americans caloric intake rose NUM frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what health officials call the american obesity epidemic 
highly sweetened soft drinks are popular sugared beverages account for NUM of the average americans daily caloric intake 
hamburgers fries and doughnuts are considered american foods 
some representative american foods

family arrangements in the united states reflect the nature of contemporary american society as they always have 
although the nuclear family concept two-married adults with biological children holds a special place in the mindset of americans it is single-parent families childless couples and fused families which now constitute the majority of families 
a person may grow up in a single-parent family go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement then get divorced live as a single for a couple of years remarry have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement 
the nuclear family .. is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of family .. the old definition of what a family is .. the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today according to many social scientists edwards NUM stacey NUM
thus has arisen the term postmodern family which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms including single-parent families and child-free couples - brian k williams stacey c sawyer carl m wahlstrom marriages families  intimate relationships NUM
single-parent households are households consisting of a single adult most often a woman and one or more children 
in the single-parent household one parent typically raises the children with little to no help at all from the other 
this parent is the sole breadwinner of the family and thus these households are particularly vulnerable economically 
they have higher rates of poverty and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems 
other changes to the landscape of american family arrangements include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among american youths 
whereas most families in the NUMs and NUMs relied on one income earner most commonly the husband the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners 
another change is the increasing age at which young americans leave their parental home 
traditionally a person past college age who lived with their parents was viewed negatively but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties 
this trend can be mostly attributed to rising living costs that are more expensive compared to those in decades past 
thus many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-twenties 
this topic was a cover article of time magazine in NUM
exceptions to the custom of leaving home in ones mid-twenties can occur especially among italian and hispanic americans and in expensive urban real estate markets such as new york city california and honolulu where monthly rents commonly exceed NUM a month 
historically americans mainly lived in a rural environment with a few important cities of moderate size 
following world war ii however increasing numbers of americans began living in the suburbs belts around major cities with higher density than rural areas but much lower than urban areas 
this move has been attributed to many factors such as the automobile the availability of large tracts of land the convenience of more and longer paved roads increasing violence in urban centers see white flight and the lower expense of housing 
these new single-family houses were usually one or two stories tall and often were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer and often with little variation sometimes referred to as cookie cutter houses or homes
houses were separated 
the resulting low-density development was given the pejorative label urban sprawl 
this has changed white flight has reversed as yuppies and upper-middle-class empty nest baby boomers return to urban living usually in condominiums such as in new york citys lower east side chicagos south loop and miamis brickell neighborhood 
the result has been the displacement of many poorer inner-city residents 
american cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the middle income neighborhoods those with median income between NUM and NUM of the metropolitan areas median household income 
here the more affluent members of the middle-class who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle-class have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs 
this trend is largely attributed to the middle-class squeeze which has caused a starker distinction between the statistical middle class and the more privileged members of the middle class 
in more expensive areas such as california however another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former middle-middle-class neighborhoods into upper-middle-class neighborhoods 
the population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment 
the great exodus from the farms came in the NUMs in recent years fewer than NUM of the population lives on farms though others live in the countryside and commute to work
electricity and telephones and sometimes cable and internet services are available to all but the most remote regions 
about half of americans now live in what is known as the suburbs 
the suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the american dream a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs 
this archetype is reinforced by mass media religious practices and government policies and is based on traditions from anglo-saxon cultures 
one of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living is the housing occupied by the families 
the suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts industrial areas and sometimes even public schools 
however many american suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales attracting more people to these communities 
housing in urban areas may include more apartments and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns 
aside from housing the major differences from suburban living are the density and diversity of many different subcultures and retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas 
due to the low overall population density and urban sprawl the united states is one of the few developed nations where most people commute by car 
the rise of suburbs and the need for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularity of automobiles 
in NUM NUM of americans drove to work by car 
lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large powerful cars 
the culture in the NUMs and NUMs often catered to the automobile with motels and drive-in restaurants 
outside of the relatively few urban areas it is considered a necessity for most americans to own and drive cars 
new york city is the only locality in the united states where more than half of all households do not own a car 
in the NUMs and NUMs subcultures began to arise around the modification and racing of american automobiles and converting them into hot rods 
later in the late-NUMs and early-NUMs detroit manufacturers began making muscle cars and pony cars to cater to the needs of wealthier americans seeking hot rod style performance and appeal 
though most americans in the NUMst century identify themselves as middle class american society and its culture are considerably fragmented 
social class generally described as a combination of educational attainment income and occupational prestige is one of the greatest cultural influences in america 
nearly all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the us are guided by a persons location within the countrys social structure 
distinct lifestyles consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes 
early sociologist-economist thorstein veblen for example said that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption 
upper-middle-class persons commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values 
persons in this particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority knowledge and thus credibility 
they often tend to engage in the consumption of so-called mass luxuries such as designer label clothing 
a strong preference for natural materials and organic foods and a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle class 
american middle-class individuals in general value expanding ones horizon partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels 
working-class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be real work and keep very close-knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability 
working-class americans and many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation 
in contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize supervise and share their thoughts many americans have little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace 
as a result white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work 
more recently those in the center of the income strata who may still identify as middle class have faced increasing economic insecurity supporting the idea of a working-class majority 
political behavior is affected by class more affluent individuals are more likely to vote and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the democratic or republican party 
income also had a significant impact on health as those with higher incomes had better access to health care facilities higher life expectancy lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness 
this is particularly noticeable with black voters who are often socially conservative yet overwhelmingly vote democratic 
in the united states occupation is one of the prime factors of social class and is closely linked to an individuals identity 
the average work week in the us for those employed full-time was NUM.NUM hours long with NUM of the population working more than NUM hours a week 
the average american worker earned NUM.NUM an hour in the first two quarters of NUM
overall americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post-industrial nations 
while the average worker in denmark enjoyed NUM days of vacation annually the average american had NUM annual vacation days 
in NUM the average american worked NUM hours per year NUM hours more than the average german yet NUM hours less than the average czech 
overall the us labor force is one of the most productive in the world largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country excluding south korea
americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard being busy and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem 
race in the united states is based on physical characteristics  skin color and has played an essential part in shaping american society even before the nations conception 
until the civil rights movement of the NUMs racial minorities in the united states faced institutionalized discrimination and both social and economic marginalization 
today the us department of commerces bureau of the census recognizes four races native american or american indian african american asian and white european american
according to the us government hispanic americans do not constitute a race but rather an ethnic group 
during the NUM us census whites made up NUM.NUM of the population those who are hispanic or latino constituted the nations prevalent minority with NUM.NUM of the population 
african americans made up NUM.NUM of the total population NUM.NUM were asian american and NUM.NUM were native american 
the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitutionratified on dec NUM NUMabolished slavery in the united states 
the northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century though their industrial economies relied on raw materials produced by slaves 
following the reconstruction period in the NUMs racist legislation emerged in the southern states named the jim crow laws that provided for legal segregation 
lynching was practiced throughout the us  including in the northern states until the NUMs while continuing well into the civil rights movement in the south 
chinese americans were earlier marginalized as well during a significant proportion of us history 
between NUM-NUM the united states instituted the chinese exclusion act barring all chinese immigrants from entering the united states 
during the second world war roughly NUM japanese americans NUM of whom were us citizens were imprisoned in japanese internment camps by the us government following the attacks on pearl harbor an american military base by japanese troops 
due to exclusion from or marginalization by earlier mainstream society there emerged a unique subculture among the racial minorities in the united states 
during the NUMs harlem new york became home to the harlem renaissance 
music styles such as jazz blues rap rock and roll and numerous folk-songs such as blue tail fly jimmy crack corn originated within the realms of african-american culture and were later adopted by the mainstream 
chinatowns can be found in many cities across the country and asian cuisine has become a common staple in mainstream america 
the hispanic community has also had a dramatic impact on american culture 
today catholics are the largest religious denomination in the united states and outnumber protestants in the southwest and california 
mariachi music and mexican cuisine are commonly found throughout the southwest and some latin dishes such as burritos and tacos are found practically everywhere in the nation 
economic variance and substantive segregation is commonplace in the united states 
asian americans have median household income and educational attainment exceeding that of other races 
african americans hispanics and native americans have considerably lower income and education than do white americans or asian americans 
in NUM the median household income of whites was NUM.NUM higher than that of african americans nearly one-quarter of whom live below the poverty line 
NUM.NUM of homicide victims in the united states are african-american 
after the attacks by muslim terrorists on september NUM NUM discrimination against arabs and muslims in the us rose significantly 
the american-arab anti-discrimination committee adc reported an increase in hate speech cases of airline discrimination hate crimes police misconduct and racial profiling 
it is customary for americans to hold a wake in a funeral home within a couple days of the death of a loved one 
the body of the deceased may be embalmed and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open-casket viewing 
traditional jewish and muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming 
friends relatives and acquaintances gather often from distant parts of the country to pay their last respects to the deceased 
flowers are brought to the coffin and sometimes eulogies elegies personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited 
otherwise the attendees sit stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer 
kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among italian americans and others 
condolences are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives 
a funeral may be held immediately afterwards or the next day 
the funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture 
american catholics typically hold a funeral mass in a church which sometimes takes the form of a requiem mass 
jewish americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple 
pallbearers carry the coffin of the deceased to the hearse which then proceeds in a procession to the place of final repose usually a cemetery 
the unique jazz funeral of new orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession 
mount auburn cemetery founded in NUM is known as americas first garden cemetery 
american cemeteries created since are distinctive for their park-like setting 
rows of graves are covered by lawns and are interspersed with trees and flowers 
headstones mausoleums statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves 
cremation is another common practice in the united states though it is frowned upon by various religions 
the ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an urn which may be kept in a private house or they are interred 
sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere 
the sprinkling or scattering of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony often taking place at a scenic natural feature a cliff lake or mountain that was favored by the deceased 
a so-called death industry has developed in the united states that has replaced earlier more informal traditions 
before the popularity of funeral homes people usually held wakes in the parlour rooms of private houses 
marriage laws are established by individual states 
the typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister priest or rabbi depending upon the faith of the couple 
in traditional christian ceremonies the brides father will give away hand off the bride to the groom 
secular weddings are also common often presided over by a judge justice of the peace or other municipal official 
same-sex marriage is legal in all states 
polygamy is universally banned 
divorce is the province of state governments so divorce law varies from state to state 
prior to the NUMs divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or sin like abandonment or adultery when spouses simply could not get along lawyers were forced to manufacture uncontested divorces 
the no-fault divorce revolution began in NUM in california new york and south dakota were the last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce 
no-fault divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences is now available in all states 
however many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree 
state law provides for child support where children are involved and sometimes for alimony 
married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did NUM years ago and four times as often as they did NUM years ago .. between NUM and NUM of new marriages will eventually end in divorce 
the probability within .. the first five years is NUM and the probability of its ending within the first NUM years is NUM... perhaps NUM of children ages NUM and under live with a stepparent 
the median length for a marriage in the us today is NUM years with NUM of all divorces being settled out of court 
white americans non-hispaniclatino and hispaniclatino are the racial majority and have a NUM share of the us population according to the NUM us census 
hispanic and latino americans comprise NUM of the population making up the largest ethnic minority 
black americans are the largest racial minority comprising nearly NUM of the population 
the white non-hispanic or latino population comprises NUM of the nations total 
throughout most of the countrys history following independence from great britain the majority race in the united states has been caucasian and the largest racial minority has been african-americans 
this relationship has historically been the most important one since the founding of the united states 
currently most african-americans are descendants of african slaves imported to the united states though some are more recent immigrants or their descendants 
slavery existed in the united states at the time of the countrys formation in the NUMs 
the us banned importation of slaves in NUM
slavery was partially abolished by the emancipation proclamation issued by president abraham lincoln in NUM for slaves in the southeastern united states during the civil war 
slavery was rendered illegal by the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution 
jim crow laws prevented full use of african american citizenship until the NUMth century 
the civil rights movement in the NUMs and the civil rights act of NUM outlawed official or legal segregation in public places or limited access to minorities 
relations between white americans and other racial or ethnic groups have been a source of tension at various times in us history 
with the advent of european colonization and continuing into the early years of the republic relations between whites and native american was a significant issue 
in NUM in response to chinese immigration due to the gold rush and the labor needed for the transcontinental railroad the us signed into law the chinese exclusion act which banned immigration by chinese people into the us 
in the late NUMth century the growth of the hispanic population in the us  fueled largely by mexican immigration generated debate over policies such as english as the official language and reform to immigration policies 
a huge majority of americans of all races disapprove of racism 
nevertheless some americans continue to hold negative racialethnic stereotypes about various racial and ethnic groups 
professor imani perry of princeton university has argued that contemporary racism in the united states is frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of cognition 
american attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the countrys history 
in the NUMth century alcohol was readily available and consumed and no laws restricted the use of other drugs 
attitudes on drug addiction started to change resulting in the harrison act which eventually became proscriptive 
a movement to ban alcoholic beverages called the temperance movement emerged in the late NUMth century 
several american protestant religious groups and womens groups such as the womens christian temperance union supported the movement 
in NUM prohibitionists succeeded in amending the constitution to prohibit the sale of alcohol 
although the prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol 
prohibition was repealed in NUM
states and localities retained the right to remain dry and to this day a handful still do 
during the vietnam war era attitudes swung well away from prohibition 
commentators noted that an NUM-year-old could be drafted to war but could not buy a beer 
since NUM the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use 
the focus this time however has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright 
new york was the first state to enact tough drunk-driving laws in NUM since then all other states have followed suit 
all states have also banned the purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under NUM
a just say no to drugs movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the NUMs 
this led to stricter drug laws and greater police latitude in drug cases 
drugs are however widely available and NUM of americans NUM and older used an illicit drug in NUM
since the NUMs marijuana use has become increasingly tolerated in america and a number of states allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes 
in most states marijuana is still illegal without medical prescription 
since the NUM general election voters in the district of columbia and the states of alaska california colorado maine massachusetts nevada oregon and washington approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use 
marijuana is classified as illegal under federal law

from the time of its inception the military played a decisive role in the history of the united states 
a sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious first barbary war second barbary war and the war of NUM
even so the founders were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of world war ii did a large standing army become officially established 
the national security act of NUM adopted following world war ii and during the onset of the cold war created the modern us military framework the act merged previously cabinet-level department of war and the department of the navy into the national military establishment renamed the department of defense in NUM headed by the secretary of defense and created the department of the air force and national security council 
the us military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel 
it draws its manpower from a large pool of paid volunteers although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace it has not been used since NUM
as of NUM the united states spends about NUMbillion annually to fund its military forces and appropriates approximately NUMbillion to fund overseas contingency operations 
put together the united states constitutes roughly NUM percent of the worlds military expenditures 
the us armed forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment along with widespread placement of forces around the world giving them significant capabilities in both defense and power projection 
there is and has been a strong military culture among those on active duty those in the reserve and national guard those retired from the military and honorably discharged veterans who never served long enough on active duty andor in the reserve or national guard to qualify for military retirement pay and benefits 
in sharp contrast to most other developed nations firearms laws in the united states are permissive and private gun ownership is common almost half of american households contain at least one firearm 
in fact there are more privately owned firearms in the united states than in any other country both per capita and in total

gun ownership tends to be more common in rural than in urban areas 
hunting plinking and target shooting are popular pastimes although ownership of firearms for purely utilitarian purposes such as personal protection is common as well 
in fact personal protection was the most common reason given for gun ownership in a NUM gallup poll of gun owners at NUM

however many state and city governments have a department dedicated to cultural affairs 
the hollywood cinema industry has been very influential on american culture and to some extent in global culture through transmission of american movies overseas and as other film cultures like bollywood have striven to emulate the american model 
the united states has influenced the cultures of many other countries but as countries around the world become more inter-connected and inter-dependent the general cultural trends of the us and other countries head towards multiculturalism and sociocultural globalization

the story starts with a fictional foreword by one john ray jr  phd an editor of psychology books 
in it ray writes that hes presenting the details of a memoir entitled the confession of a white widowed male written by a literary scholar of mixed european ethnicity who died recently in an american jail of heart failure while awaiting his murder trial 
the memoirs author uses the pseudonym humbert humbert to refer to himself in the manuscript 
humbert begins the memoir with his parisian childhood and ends it with his incarceration 
the story is told entirely from humberts perspective 
ray says he received the memoir from humberts lawyer cc 
clark and adds that he ray has changed the names of the people mentioned in it to protect their identities except for one lolita the nickname humbert used to refer to the young girl with whom he was sexually obsessed 
ray notes that lolita died in NUM while giving birth to a stillborn girl on christmas day while married to richard schiller presumably the father of her child 
after losing his mother at a young age humbert has a rich childhood living in his wealthy fathers hotel 
at the age of NUM humbert has a precocious relationship with a girl his age annabel leigh but her family moves away before they get the chance to have full sex 
annabel dies shortly thereafter of typhus 
following this humbert finds he has a hebephilic fixation with certain girls ages NUM to NUM which he identifies as nymphets
he claims the cause of his fixation is the grief he experienced over annabels death in his youth 
humbert visits many prostitutes as a young adult but is unsatisfied unless they resemble a nymphet 
he eventually marries a polish woman named valeria to allay suspicion of his hebephilia 
humbert plans on migrating to america and leaving her after several years of marriage only for the marriage to dissolve anyway after she admits to having an affair 
later humbert suffers a mental breakdown and recovers in a psychiatric hospital 
upon his release he moves to the united states to write living off an allowance left by a wealthy uncle in return for writing perfume adverts 
after a year attached to an arctic expedition the only time in his life he claims to have been free of his tortured yearning humbert suffers another mental breakdown and learns to manipulate psychiatrists while he recovers 
relieved of his perfume duties while still entitled to the allowance humbert plans to move to south america to take advantage of looser laws concerning the age of consent 
however hes offered to board and lodge with the mccoo family living in the fictional new england town of ramsdale and he accepts purely because they have a NUM year-old daughter whom he plans to spy on 
upon his arrival he discovers that their house has burned down charlotte haze a wealthy ramsdale widow offers to accommodate him instead and humbert visits her residence out of politeness 
he initially plans to decline charlottes offer but agrees to rent when he sees her NUM-year-old daughter dolores whom charlotte calls lo.humbert is instantly smitten and fantasizes constantly about lo 
charlotte and dolores have a poisonous relationship and frequently row while humbert finds himself growing infatuated with dolores and privately nicknames her lolita
over the course of a single month humberts entire life comes to revolve around masturbating to lolita 
he starts a diary in which he records his obsessive fantasies about dolores while also expressing loathsome feelings for charlotte whom he sees as an obstacle to his passion 
one sunday morning while charlotte is out of the house dolores and humbert engage in a somewhat flirtatious interaction ending with lolita sitting on humberts knee 
humbert uses the interaction to bring himself to ejaculate which dolores does not apparently notice 
charlotte decides to send dolores to summer camp where she will stay for three weeks 
on the day of leaving lolita runs back upstairs and kisses humbert on the lips before returning to the car 
the housemaid gives humbert a letter from charlotte shortly thereafter in which she confesses that she has fallen in love with him 
she adds that if he doesnt love her back he must move out immediately 
humberts solution to this dilemma is to marry charlotte for purely instrumental reasons - it will let him stay close to dolores and even let him innocently fondle her out of feigned parternalism 
later charlotte voices her plan to send dolores to a boarding school when she returns from camp 
humbert contemplates murdering charlotte to remain close to dolores and even comes close to drowning her in the town lake but stops before carrying it out 
humbert instead acquires strong sedatives from the town doctor planning to put both hazes to sleep so that he can molest dolores in the night 
a few days later however charlotte finds humberts diary and furiously confronts him telling him he will never see dolores again 
while humbert prepares a drink for her charlotte runs out of the house to mail letters shes written to friends about humberts lust for dolores but is killed by a swerving car 
humbert recovers the letters from the accident scene and destroys them 
later he convinces charlottes friends and neighbors that he should look after dolores as he is now her stepfather 
humbert retrieves dolores from camp and lies to her telling her that charlotte is ill and has been hospitalized 
he then takes her to a high-end hotel that charlotte had earlier recommended 
humbert feels guilty about consciously raping her and so tricks her into taking the sedatives in her ice cream 
as he waits for the pill to take effect he wanders through the hotel and meets an anonymous man who he does not know is in fact famous playwright clare quilty a friend of the now-deceased charlotte 
quilty recognises dolores and without revealing anything talks ambiguously to humbert about his daughter
humbert excuses himself from the conversation and returns to the hotel room 
there he discovers that the doctor fobbed him with a milder drug as dolores is merely drowsy and wakes up frequently drifting in and out of sleep 
he dares not touch her that night 
in the morning lo reveals to humbert that she actually has already lost her virginity having engaged in sexual activity with an older boy at a different camp a year ago at age NUM
humbert tricks her into believing that he has no knowledge of sex play and it is not something that adults do 
she wants to show him and so the two have sex 
while driving the next day dolores is ambiguously uncomfortable and insists on calling her mother from a pay phone it is only then that humbert finally reveals to dolores that her mother is dead 
humbert and dolores begin traveling across the country driving all day and staying in motels 
to keep dolores from going to the police or running away humbert points out she would likely wind up in a state-run orphanage if she leaves him a prospect which terrifies her 
he manipulates her with gifts of money and clothing in return for sexual favors 
completely paranoid about the situation and increasingly jealous of her flirtations with others humbert controls doloress movements carefully and forbids her from associating with other teenagers 
after a year of touring the united states dolores pressures humbert to settle and so he takes her to the fictional new england town of beardsley where he enrolls her in the local girls school 
humbert reluctantly grants dolores permission to join the school play which unbeknownst to humbert was written by quilty 
the living situation between the two grows increasingly tense erupting into a row before the plays opening night 
humbert grabs dolores by the wrist and injures her during the quarrel and while hes distracted by a neighbour she flees the apartment 
humbert chases after her and finds her using a pay phone in a drug store 
while talking to her humbert finds that dolores has had a complete change of heart 
she decides not to participate in the school play and asks humbert to take her on another cross-country trip 
humbert eagerly agrees 
back at the apartment lo is unusually flirtatious and the two have sex once more 
while on their second road trip humbert becomes suspicious that a driver is following them 
he swears he sees dolores talking to a man he barely recognises driving a conspicuous red car and on another occasion dolores seems to sabotage his effort to confront the man 
later humbert leaves dolores in a texas hotel to run errands returning to discover doloress hair disheveled and her make up smudged 
he strongly suspects she has had sex with another man while he was out but he has no way to prove it 
in the colorado mountains dolores falls ill and humbert checks her into a hospital while he stays in a nearby motel 
after several days he contacts a nurse at the hospital to inquire about doloress condition he is surprised when the nurse tells him that she has already checked out 
an uncle has paid her bill and taken her to her grandfathers home humbert knows lolita has no living relatives and he immediately embarks on a frantic search to find dolores and her abductor but ultimately fails 
for the next two years humbert barely sustains himself in a moderately-functional relationship with a notorious californian alcoholic named rita 
deeply depressed humbert receives a letter from the residents of ramsdale who have learnt that dolores has gone missing and are pressing for answers 
knowing that his situation is precarious and contemplating what to do humbert eventually receives another letter - its from dolores now NUM telling him that she is married pregnant and in desperate need of money 
dolores tells him to deliver NUM cash to her residence in the town of coalmont where she lives with her husband richard schiller 
she did not provide humbert with her street address 
humbert nevertheless immediately leaves new york for coalmont he believes schiller is the abductor and plans to murder him as soon as possible 
he tracks down dolores and finds her living in a clapboard house with her husband who is not the abductor 
humbert and dolores awkwardly discuss her new married life dolores passing humbert as her real father to her husband and cheerily pretending their past never happened 
humbert no longer feels any sexual attraction to the now-matured dolores but nevertheless realizes hes still in love with her 
he gives her ten times as much money as she asked for and then asks her to abandon this life and leave with him 
she accepts the money but firmly declines the offer of a life together 
as he is leaving dolores reveals to humbert that it was quilty who took her from the hospital and that she willingly left because she was in love with him 
after moving into his mansion in ramsdale for a period quilty tried to make her star in one of his pornographic films 
she refused and so he expelled her from his home 
afterward she supported herself by working as a waitress 
humbert leaves in tears resolving to track down and kill quilty 
returning to ramsdale humbert visits quiltys uncle who is a local dentist and learns the location of quiltys mansion 
humbert arrives at the mansion to find a hedonistic lair with the front door unlocked and quilty under the influence of drugs 
quilty at first thinks humbert is an electricity man then just another actor or socialite taking advantage of his generosity 
even after revealing himself and his purpose quilty still barely takes humbert seriously and only after a few tussles does he attempt to talk down humbert from killing him 
eventually humbert shoots quilty in a chase around the mansion he leaves as a large number of quiltys guests arrive who also do not take the idea of quiltys murder seriously 
later humbert allows himself to be captured by police while driving recklessly in a daze around ramsdale 
in his closing thoughts humbert expresses his belief that he is guilty of statutory rape but all other charges against himself should be dismissed 
he reaffirms his love for lolita and asks for his confession to be withheld from public release until after her death 
lolita is frequently described as an erotic novel both by some critics but also in a standard reference work on literature facts on file companion to the american short story
the great soviet encyclopedia called lolita an experiment in combining an erotic novel with an instructive novel of manners
the same description of the novel is found in desmond morriss reference work the book of ages
a survey of books for womens studies courses describes it as a tongue-in-cheek erotic novel
books focused on the history of erotic literature such as michael perkins the secret record modern erotic literature also so classify lolita
more cautious classifications have included a novel with erotic motifs or one of a number of works of classical erotic literature and art and to novels that contain elements of eroticism like .. ulysses and lady chatterleys lover
this classification has been disputed 
malcolm bradbury writes at first famous as an erotic novel lolita soon won its way as a literary onea late modernist distillation of the whole crucial mythology 
samuel schuman says that nabokov is a surrealist linked to gogol dostoyevsky and kafka 
lolita is characterized by irony and sarcasm it is not an erotic novel 
lance olsen writes the first NUM chapters of the text culminating with the oft-cited scene of lo unwittingly stretching her legs across humberts excited lap .. are the only chapters suggestive of the erotic 
nabokov himself observes in the novels afterword that a few readers were misled 
by the opening of the book... into assuming this was going to be a lewd book .. expecting the rising succession of erotic scenes when these stopped the readers stopped too and felt bored 
the novel is narrated by humbert who riddles the narrative with word play and his wry observations of american culture 
the novels flamboyant style is characterized by double entendres multilingual puns anagrams and coinages such as nymphet a word that has since had a life of its own and can be found in most dictionaries and the lesser-used faunlet
most writers see humbert as an unreliable narrator and credit nabokovs powers as an ironist 
for richard rorty in his interpretation of lolita in contingency irony and solidarity humbert is a monster of incuriosity 
nabokov himself described humbert as a vain and cruel wretch and a hateful person 
critics have further noted that since the novel is a first person narrative by humbert the novel gives very little information about what lolita is like as a person that in effect she has been silenced by not being the books narrator 
nomi tamir-ghez writes not only is lolitas voice silenced her point of view the way she sees the situation and feels about it is rarely mentioned and can be only surmised by the reader .. since it is humbert who tells the story .. throughout most of the novel the reader is absorbed in humberts feelings
similarly mica howe and sarah appleton aguiar write that the novel silences and objectifies lolita 
christine clegg notes that this is a recurring theme in criticism of the novel in the NUMs 
actor brian cox who played humbert in a NUM one-man stage monologue based on the novel stated that the novel is not about lolita as a flesh and blood entity 
its lolita as a memory
he concluded that a stage monologue would be truer to the book than any film could possibly be 
elizabeth janeway writing in the new york times book review holds humbert is every man who is driven by desire wanting his lolita so badly that it never occurs to him to consider her as a human being or as anything but a dream-figment made flesh
clegg sees the novels non-disclosure of lolitas feelings as directly linked to the fact that her real name is dolores and only humbert refers to her as lolita 
humbert also states he has effectively solipsized lolita early in the novel 
eric lemay writes
in NUM iranian expatriate azar nafisi published the memoir reading lolita in tehran about a covert womens reading group 
in an npr interview nafisi contrasts the sorrowful and seductive sides of doloreslolitas character 
she notes because her name is not lolita her real name is dolores which as you know in latin means dolour so her real name is associated with sorrow and with anguish and with innocence while lolita becomes a sort of light-headed seductive and airy name 
the lolita of our novel is both of these at the same time and in our culture here today we only associate it with one aspect of that little girl and the crassest interpretation of her 
following nafisis comments the npr interviewer madeleine brand lists as embodiments of the latter side of lolita the long island lolita britney spears the olsen twins and sue lyon in stanley kubricks lolita
for nafisi the essence of the novel is humberts solipsism and his erasure of lolitas independent identity 
she writes lolita was given to us as humberts creature  to reinvent her humbert must take from lolita her own real history and replace it with his own .
yet she does have a past 
despite humberts attempts to orphan lolita by robbing her of her history that past is still given to us in glimpses 
one of the novels early champions lionel trilling warned in NUM of the moral difficulty in interpreting a book with so eloquent and so self-deceived a narrator we find ourselves the more shocked when we realize that in the course of reading the novel we have come virtually to condone the violation it presents .. we have been seduced into conniving in the violation because we have permitted our fantasies to accept what we know to be revolting 
a minority of critics have accepted humberts version of events at face value 
in NUM dorothy parker described the novel as the engrossing anguished story of a man a man of taste and culture who can love only little girls and lolita as a dreadful little creature selfish hard vulgar and foul-tempered
in NUM novelist robertson davies excused the narrator entirely writing that the theme of lolita is not the corruption of an innocent child by a cunning adult but the exploitation of a weak adult by a corrupt child 
this is no pretty theme but it is one with which social workers magistrates and psychiatrists are familiar 
in his essay on stalinism koba the dread martin amis proposes that lolita is an elaborate metaphor for the totalitarianism that destroyed the russia of nabokovs childhood though nabokov states in his afterword that he detests symbols and allegories
amis interprets it as a story of tyranny told from the point of view of the tyrant 
nabokov in all his fiction writes with incomparable penetration about delusion and coercion about cruelty and lies he says 
even lolita especially lolita is a study in tyranny 
nabokov finished lolita on NUM december NUM five years after starting it 
because of its subject matter nabokov intended to publish it pseudonymously although the anagrammatic character vivian darkbloom would tip off the alert reader
the manuscript was turned down with more or less regret by viking simon  schuster new directions farrar straus and doubleday 
after these refusals and warnings he finally resorted to publication in france 
via his translator doussia ergaz it reached maurice girodias of olympia press three-quarters of whose list was pornographic trash
underinformed about olympia overlooking hints of girodiass approval of the conduct of a protagonist girodias presumed was based on the author and despite warnings from morris bishop his friend at cornell nabokov signed a contract with olympia press for publication of the book to come out under his own name 
lolita was published in september NUM as a pair of green paperbacks swarming with typographical errors
although the first printing of NUM copies sold out there were no substantial reviews 
eventually at the very end of NUM graham greene in the london sunday times called it one of the three best books of NUM
this statement provoked a response from the london sunday express whose editor john gordon called it the filthiest book i have ever read and sheer unrestrained pornography
british customs officers were then instructed by a panicked home office to seize all copies entering the united kingdom 
in december NUM france followed suit and the minister of the interior banned lolita the ban lasted for two years 
its eventual british publication by weidenfeld  nicolson in london in NUM was controversial enough to contribute to the end of the political career of the conservative member of parliament nigel nicolson one of the companys partners 
the novel then appeared in danish and dutch translations 
two editions of a swedish translation were withdrawn at the authors request 
despite initial trepidation there was no official response in the us  and the first american edition was issued by g p putnams sons in august NUM
the book was into a third printing within days and became the first since gone with the wind to sell NUM copies in its first three weeks 
orville prescott the influential book reviewer of the new york times greatly disliked the book describing it as dull dull dull in a pretentious florid and archly fatuous fashion
this review failed to influence the books sales 
the novel continues to generate controversy today as modern society has become increasingly aware of the lasting damage created by child sexual abuse 
in NUM an entire book was published on the best ways to teach the novel in a college classroom given that its particular mix of narrative strategies ornate allusive prose and troublesome subject matter complicates its presentation to students
in this book one author urges teachers to note that lolitas suffering is noted in the book even if the main focus is on humbert 
many critics describe humbert as a rapist notably azar nafisi in her best-selling reading lolita in tehran though in a survey of critics david larmour notes that other interpreters of the novel have been reluctant to use that term 
near the end of the novel humbert accuses himself of rape 
nabokov biographer brian boyd denies that it was rape on the grounds that dolores was not a virgin and seduced humbert in the morning of their hotel stay 
this perspective is vigorously disputed by peter rabinowitz in his essay lolita solipsized or sodomized
in NUM nabokov wrote a poem named lilith  depicting a sexually attractive underage girl who seduces the male protagonist just to leave him humiliated in public 
in NUM he wrote a novella volshebnik  that was published only posthumously in NUM in english translation as the enchanter
it bears many similarities to lolita but also has significant differences it takes place in central europe and the protagonist is unable to consummate his passion with his stepdaughter leading to his suicide 
the theme of hebephilia was already touched on by nabokov in his short story a nursery tale written in NUM
also in the NUM laughter in the dark margot peters is NUM and already had an affair when middle-aged albinus becomes attracted to her 
in chapter three of the novel the gift written in russian in NUM the similar gist of lolitas first chapter is outlined to the protagonist fyodor cherdyntsev by his landlord shchyogolev as an idea of a novel he would write if i only had the time a man marries a widow only to gain access to her young daughter who resists all his passes 
shchyogolev says it happened in reality to a friend of his it is made clear to the reader that it concerns himself and his stepdaughter zina NUM at the time of shchyogolevs marriage to her mother who becomes the love of fyodors life 
in april NUM nabokov wrote to edmund wilson i am writing .. a short novel about a man who liked little girlsand its going to be called the kingdom by the sea
the work expanded into lolita during the next eight years 
nabokov used the title a kingdom by the sea in his NUM pseudo-autobiographical novel look at the harlequins
for a lolita-like book written by the narrator who in addition travels with his teenage daughter bel from motel to motel after the death of her mother later his fourth wife is bels look-alike and shares her birthday 
in nabokovs NUM novel pale fire the titular poem by fictional john shade mentions hurricane lolita coming up the american east coast in NUM and narrator charles kinbote in the commentary later in the book notes it questioning why anyone would have chosen an obscure spanish nickname for a hurricane 
there were no hurricanes named lolita that year but that is the year that lolita the novel was published in north america 
the unfinished novel the original of laura published posthumously features the character hubert h hubert an older man preying upon then-child protagonist flora 
unlike those of humbert humbert in lolita huberts advances are unsuccessful 
the novel abounds in allusions to classical and modern literature 
virtually all of them have been noted in the annotated lolita edited and annotated by alfred appel jr 
many are references to humberts own favorite poet edgar allan poe 
humbert humberts first love annabel leigh is named after the maiden in the poem annabel lee by poe this poem is alluded to many times in the novel and its lines are borrowed to describe humberts love 
a passage in chapter NUM reuses poes phrase ...by the side of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride
in the opening of the novel the phrase ladies and gentlemen of the jury exhibit number one is what the seraphs the misinformed simple noble-winged seraphs envied is a pastiche of two passages of the poem the winged seraphs of heaven line NUM and the angels not half so happy in heaven went envying her and me lines NUM
nabokov originally intended lolita to be called the kingdom by the sea drawing on the rhyme with annabel lee that was used in the first verse of poes work 
a variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one which reads ...had i not loved one summer an initial girl-child 
in a princedom by the sea
humbert humberts double name recalls poes william wilson a tale in which the main character is haunted by his doppelgnger paralleling to the presence of humberts own doppelgnger clare quilty 
humbert is not however his real name but a chosen pseudonym 
the theme of the doppelgnger also occurs in nabokovs earlier novel despair
chapter NUM of part one contains a parody of joyces stream of consciousness 
humbert humberts field of expertise is french literature one of his jobs is writing a series of educational works that compare french writers to english writers and as such there are several references to french literature including the authors gustave flaubert marcel proust franois rabelais charles baudelaire prosper mrime remy belleau honor de balzac and pierre de ronsard 
vladimir nabokov was fond of the works of lewis carroll and had translated alice in wonderland into russian 
he even called carroll the first humbert humbert
lolita contains a few brief allusions in the text to the alice books though overall nabokov avoided direct allusions to carroll 
in her book tramp the life of charlie chaplin joyce milton claims that a major inspiration for the novel was charlie chaplins relationship with his second wife lita grey whose real name was lillita and is often misstated as lolita 
graham vickers in his book chasing lolita how popular culture corrupted nabokovs little girl all over again argues that the two major real-world predecessors of humbert are lewis carroll and charlie chaplin 
although appels comprehensive annotated lolita contains no references to charlie chaplin others have picked up several oblique references to chaplins life in nabokovs book 
bill delaney notes that at the end lolita and her husband move to the fictional alaskan town of gray star while chaplins the gold rush set in alaska was originally set to star lita grey 
lolitas first sexual encounter was with a boy named charlie holmes whom humbert describes as the silent ..but indefatigable charlie 
chaplin had an artist paint lita grey in imitation of joshua reynoldss painting the age of innocence
when humbert visits lolita in a class at her school he notes a print of the same painting in the classroom 
delaneys article notes many other parallels as well 
the foreword refers to the monumental decision rendered december NUM NUM by hon 
john m woolsey in regard to another considerably more outspoken bookthat is the decision in the case united states v one book called ulysses in which woolsey ruled that james joyces ulysses was not obscene and could be sold in the united states 
in chapter NUM of part two humbert comments that lolita looks like botticellis russet venusthe same soft nose the same blurred beauty referencing sandro botticellis depiction of venus in perhaps the birth of venus or venus and mars
in chapter NUM of part two humberts death sentence on quilty parodies the rhythm and use of anaphora in t s eliots poem ash wednesday 
many other references to classical and romantic literature abound including references to lord byrons childe harolds pilgrimage and to the poetry of laurence sterne 
in addition to the possible prototypes of lewis carroll and charlie chaplin mentioned above in allusions alexander dolinin suggests that the prototype of lolita was NUM-year-old florence horner kidnapped in NUM by NUM-year-old mechanic frank la salle who had caught her stealing a five-cent notebook 
la salle traveled with her over various states for NUM months and is believed to have raped her 
he claimed that he was an fbi agent and threatened to turn her in for the theft and to send her to a place for girls like you 
the horner case was not widely reported but dolinin notes various similarities in events and descriptions 
while nabokov had already used the same basic idea  that of a child molester and his victim booking into a hotel as father and daughterin his then-unpublished NUM work the enchanter  he mentions the horner case explicitly in chapter NUM of part ii of lolita
german academic michael maars book the two lolitas describes his recent discovery of a NUM german short story titled lolita whose middle-aged narrator describes travelling abroad as a student 
he takes a room as a lodger and instantly becomes obsessed with the preteen girl also named lolita who lives in the same house 
maar has speculated that nabokov may have had cryptomnesia hidden memory while he was composing lolita during the NUMs 
maar says that until NUM nabokov lived in the same section of berlin as the author heinz von eschwege pen name heinz von lichberg and was most likely familiar with his work which was widely available in germany during nabokovs time there 
the philadelphia inquirer in the article lolita at NUM did nabokov take literary liberties
says that according to maar accusations of plagiarism should not apply and quotes him as saying literature has always been a huge crucible in which familiar themes are continually recast .
nothing of what we admire in lolita is already to be found in the tale the former is in no way deducible from the latter 
see also jonathan lethems essay the ecstasy of influence a plagiarism in harpers magazine on this story 
in NUM nabokov wrote an afterword to lolita on a book entitled lolita that first appeared in the first us edition and has appeared thereafter 
one of the first things nabokov makes a point of saying is that despite john ray jr s claim in the foreword there is no moral to the story 
nabokov adds that the initial shiver of inspiration for lolita was somehow prompted by a newspaper story about an ape in the jardin des plantes who after months of coaxing by a scientist produced the first drawing ever charcoaled by an animal this sketch showed the bars of the poor creatures cage
neither the article nor the drawing has been recovered 
in response to an american critic who characterized lolita as the record of nabokovs love affair with the romantic novel nabokov writes that the substitution of english language for romantic novel would make this elegant formula more correct
nabokov concludes the afterword with a reference to his beloved first language which he abandoned as a writer once he moved to the united states in NUM my private tragedy which cannot and indeed should not be anybodys concern is that i had to abandon my natural idiom my untrammeled rich and infinitely docile russian language for a second-rate brand of english
nabokov rated the book highly 
in an interview for bbc television in NUM he said
over a year later in an interview for playboy he said
in the same year in an interview with life nabokov was asked which of his writings had most pleased him 
he answered

the russian translation includes a postscriptum in which nabokov reconsiders his relationship with his native language 
referring to the afterword to the english edition nabokov states that only the scientific scrupulousness led me to preserve the last paragraph of the american afterword in the russian text .. he further explains that the story of this translation is the story of a disappointment 
alas that wonderful russian language which i imagined still awaits me somewhere which blooms like a faithful spring behind the locked gate to which i after so many years still possess the key turned out to be non-existent and there is nothing beyond that gate except for some burned out stumps and hopeless autumnal emptiness and the key in my hand looks rather like a lock pick 
lolita has been filmed twice been a musical four stage-plays one completed opera and two ballets 
there is also nabokovs unfilmed and re-edited screenplay an uncompleted opera based on the work and an imagined opera which combines elements of opera and dance 
novel

a novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction normally in prose which is typically published as a book 
the genre has been described as having a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years with its origins in classical greece and rome in medieval and early modern romance and in the tradition of the novella 
the latter an italian word for a short story to distinguish it from a novel has been used in english since the NUMth century for a work that falls somewhere in between 
ian watt in the rise of the novel suggested in NUM that the novel first came into being in the early NUMth century 
miguel de cervantes author of don quixote the first part of which was published in NUM is frequently cited as the first significant european novelist of the modern era 
the romance is a closely related long prose narrative 
walter scott defined it as a fictitious narrative in prose or verse the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents whereas in the novel the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society
however many romances including the historical romances of scott emily bronts wuthering heights and herman melvilles moby-dick are also frequently called novels and scott describes romance as a kindred term
romance as defined here should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel 
other european languages do not distinguish between romance and novel a novel is le roman der roman il romanzo.
the word novella or novelle is however used in most european languages to describe a long short story or a short novel 
a novel is a long fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences 
the novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose style 
the development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing and the introduction of cheap paper in the NUMth century 
the present english and spanish word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the italian novella for new news or short story of something new itself from the latin novella a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus diminutive of novus meaning new
most european languages use the word romance as in french dutch russian slovene serbo-croatian romanian danish swedish and norwegian roman finnish romaani german roman portuguese romance and italian romanzo for extended narratives 
fictionality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from historiography 
however this can be a problematic criterion 
throughout the early modern period authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion 
historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes 
novels can on the other hand depict the social political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history 
while prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel the ancestors of the modern european novel include verse epics in the romance language of southern france especially those by chrtien de troyes late NUMth century and in middle english geoffrey chaucers c NUM  NUM the canterbury tales
even in the NUMth century fictional narratives in verse such as lord byrons don juan NUM alexander pushkins yevgeniy onegin NUM and elizabeth barrett brownings aurora leigh NUM competed with prose novels 
vikram seths the golden gate NUM composed of NUM onegin stanzas is a more recent example of the verse novel 
both in NUMth-century japan and NUMth-century europe prose fiction created intimate reading situations 
on the other hand verse epics including the odyssey and aeneid had been recited to a select audiences though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters 
a new world of individualistic fashion personal views intimate feelings secret anxieties conduct and gallantry spread with novels and the associated prose-romance 
the novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction followed by the novella 
however in the NUMth century critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival 
a precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction is however not possiblethe requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the totality of life 
although early forms of the novel are to be found in a number of places including classical rome NUMth and NUMth-century japan and elizabethan england the european novel is often said to have begun with don quixote in NUM
early works of extended fictional prose or novels include works in latin like the satyricon by petronius c NUM ad and the golden ass by apuleius c NUM ad works in ancient greek such as daphnis and chloe by longus c late second century adworks in sanskrit such as the NUMth or NUMth-century daakumracarita by dain and in the NUMth-century kadambari by banabhatta murasaki shikibus NUMth-century japanese work the tale of genji the NUMth-century hayy ibn yaqdhan or philosophus autodidactus the NUMth-century latin title by ibn tufail who wrote in arabic the NUMth-century theologus autodidactus by ibn al-nafis another arabic novelist and blanquerna written in catalan by ramon llull NUM and the NUMth-century chinese romance of the three kingdoms by luo guanzhong 
murasaki shikibus tale of genji NUM has been described as the worlds first novel and shows essentially all the qualities for which marie de la fayettes novel la princesse de clves NUM has been praised individuality of perception an interest in character development and psychological observation 
urbanization and the spread of printed books in song dynasty NUM china led to the evolution of oral storytelling into fictional novels by the ming dynasty NUM
parallel european developments did not occur until after the invention the printing press by johannes gutenberg in NUM and the rise of the publishing industry over a century later allowed for similar opportunities 
by contrast ibn tufails hayy ibn yaqdhan and ibn al-nafis theologus autodidactus are works of didactic philosophy and theology 
in this sense hayy ibn yaqdhan would be considered an early example of a philosophical novel while theologus autodidactus would be considered an early theological novel 
hayy ibn yaqdhan with its story of a human outcast surviving on an island is also likely to have influenced daniel defoes robinson crusoe NUM because the work was available in an english edition in NUM
epic poetry exhibits some similarities with the novel and the western tradition of the novel reaches back into the field of verse epics though again not in an unbroken tradition 
the epics of asia such as the sumerian epic of gilgamesh NUM bc and indian epics such as the ramayana NUM bce and NUM ce and mahabharata NUMth century bc were as unknown in early modern europe as was the anglo-saxon epic of beowulf c NUM ad which was rediscovered in the late NUMth century and early NUMth century 
other non-european works such as the torah the koran and the bible are full of stories and thus have also had a significant influence on the development of prose narratives and therefore the novel 
then at the beginning of the NUMth century french prose translations brought homers works to a wider public who accepted them as forerunners of the novel 
classical greek and roman prose narratives included a didactic strand with the philosopher platos c NUMc NUM bc dialogues a satirical dimension with petronius satyricon the incredible stories of lucian of samosata and lucius apuleius proto-picaresque the golden ass as well as the heroic romances of the greeks heliodorus and longus 
longus is the author of the famous greek novel daphnis and chloe NUMnd century ad
romance or chivalric romance is a type of narrative in prose or verse popular in the aristocratic circles of high medieval and early modern europe 
they were marvel-filled adventures often of a knight-errant with heroic qualities who undertakes a quest yet it is the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the chanson de geste and other kinds of epic which involve heroism 
in later romances particularly those of french origin there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of courtly love 
originally romance literature was written in old french anglo-norman and occitan later in english italian and german 
during the early NUMth century romances were increasingly written as prose 
the shift from verse to prose dates from the early NUMth century 
the prose lancelot or vulgate cycle includes passages from that period 
this collection indirectly led to thomas malorys le morte darthur of the early NUMs 
prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose and could also be more easily translated 
popular literature also drew on themes of romance but with ironic satiric or burlesque intent 
romances reworked legends fairy tales and history but by about NUM they were out of fashion and miguel de cervantes famously burlesqued them in don quixote NUM
still the modern image of medieval is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre and the word medieval evokes knights distressed damsels dragons and such tropes 
around NUM the connotations of romance was modified with the development gothic fiction 
the term novel originates from the production of short stories or novella that remained part of a european oral culture of storytelling into the late NUMth century 
fairy tales jokes and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation and the exemplum a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition 
written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as boccaccios decameron NUM and geoffrey chaucers canterbury tales NUM
the decameron NUM was a compilation of one hundred novelle told by ten peopleseven women and three menfleeing the black death by escaping from florence to the fiesole hills in NUM
the modern distinction between history and fiction did not exist in the early sixteenth century and the grossest improbabilities pervade many historical accounts found in the early modern print market 
william caxtons NUM edition of thomas malorys le morte darthur NUM was sold as a true history though the story unfolded in a series of magical incidents and historical improbabilities 
sir john mandevilles voyages written in the NUMth century but circulated in printed editions throughout the NUMth century was filled with natural wonders which were accepted as fact like the one-footed ethiopians who use their extremity as an umbrella against the desert sun 
both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction 
in the NUMth and NUMth centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction 
the invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of chapbooks 
the more elegant production of this genre by NUMth- and NUMth-century authors were belles lettresthat is a market that would be neither low nor academic 
the second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction the spanish amadis de gaula by garca montalvo 
however it was not accepted as an example of belles lettres
the amadis eventually became the archetypical romance in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the NUMth century 
a chapbook is an early type of popular literature printed in early modern europe 
produced cheaply chapbooks were commonly small paper-covered booklets usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of NUM NUM NUM and NUM pages 
they were often illustrated with crude woodcuts which sometimes bore no relation to the text 
when illustrations were included in chapbooks they were considered popular prints 
the tradition arose in the NUMth century as soon as printed books became affordable and rose to its height during the NUMth and NUMth centuries and many different kinds of ephemera and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks such as almanacs childrens literature folk tales nursery rhymes pamphlets poetry and political and religious tracts 
the term chapbook for this type of literature was coined in the NUMth century 
the corresponding french and german terms are bibliothque bleue blue book and volksbuch respectively 
the principal historical subject matter of chapbooks was abridgements of ancient historians popular medieval histories of knights stories of comical heroes religious legends and collections of jests and fables 
the new printed books reached the households of urban citizens and country merchants who visited the cities as traders 
cheap printed histories were in the NUMth and NUMth centuries especially popular among apprentices and younger urban readers of both sexes 
the early modern market from the NUMs and NUMs divided into low chapbooks and high market expensive fashionable elegant belles lettres 
the amadis and rabelais gargantua and pantagruel were important publications with respect to this divide 
both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories rather than readers of belles lettres
the amadis was a multivolume fictional history of style that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction 
on the other hand gargantua and pantagruel while it adopted the form of modern popular history in fact satirized that genres stylistic achievements 
the division between low and high literature became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and belles lettres markets in the course of the NUMth and NUMth centuries low chapbooks included abridgments of books such as miguel cervantes don quixote NUM

the term chapbook is also in use for present-day publications commonly short inexpensive booklets 
heroic romance is a genre of imaginative literature which flourished in the NUMth century principally in france 
the beginnings of modern fiction in france took a pseudo-bucolic form and the celebrated lastre NUM of honore durfe NUM which is the earliest french novel is properly styled a pastoral 
although its action was in the main languid and sentimental there was a side of the astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory that spirit of  panache which was now rising to its height in france 
that spirit it was which animated marin le roy de gomberville NUM who was the inventor of what have since been known as the heroical romances 
in these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written 
in order to give point to the chivalrous actions of the heroes it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise 
stories of witty cheats were an integral part of the european novella with its tradition of fabliaux 
significant examples include till eulenspiegel NUM lazarillo de tormes NUM grimmelshausens simplicissimus teutsch NUM and in england richard heads the english rogue NUM
the tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life 
the adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met 
a second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to heinrich wittenwilers ring c NUM and to franois rabelais gargantua and pantagruel NUM which parodied and satirized heroic romances and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque 
cervantes don quixote NUM modified the satire of romances its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the amadisian tradition 
other important works of the tradition are paul scarrons roman comique NUM the anonymous french rozelli with its satire on europes religions alain-ren lesages gil blas NUM henry fieldings joseph andrews NUM and tom jones NUM and denis diderots jacques the fatalist NUM printed posthumously in NUM
a market of literature in the modern sense of the word that is a separate market for fiction and poetry did not exist until the late seventeenth century 
all books were sold under the rubric of history and politicks in the early NUMth century including pamphlets memoirs travel literature political analysis serious histories romances poetry and novels 
that fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the middle ages fictions were lies and therefore hardly justifiable at all 
the climate however changed in the NUMs 
the romance format of the quasihistorical works of madame daulnoy csar vichard de saint-ral gatien de courtilz de sandras and anne-marguerite petit du noyer allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth 
the literary market-place of the late NUMth and early NUMth century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories 
this permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction not truth if they ever faced allegations of libel 
prefaces and title pages of NUMth and early NUMth-century fiction acknowledged this pattern histories could claim to be romances but threaten to relate true events as in the roman  clef
other works could conversely claim to be factual histories yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented 
a further differentiation was made between private and public history daniel defoes robinson crusoe was within this pattern neither a romance nor a novel
it smelled of romance yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history 
the rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of cervantes novelas exemplares NUM
it continued with scarrons roman comique the first part of which appeared in NUM whose heroes noted the rivalry between french romances and the new spanish genre 
late NUMth-century critics looked back on the history of prose fiction proud of the generic shift that had taken place leading towards the modern novelnovella 
the first perfect works in french were those of scarron and madame de la fayettes spanish history zayde NUM
the development finally led to her princesse de clves NUM the first novel with what would become characteristic french subject matter 
europe witnessed the generic shift in the titles of works in french published in holland which supplied the international market and english publishers exploited the novelromance controversy in the NUMs and NUMs 
contemporary critics listed the advantages of the new genre brevity a lack of ambition to produce epic poetry in prose the style was fresh and plain the focus was on modern life and on heroes who were neither good nor bad 
the novels potential to become the medium of urban gossip and scandal fuelled the rise of the novelnovella 
stories were offered as allegedly true recent histories not for the sake of scandal but strictly for the moral lessons they gave 
to prove this fictionalized names were used with the true names in a separate key 
the mercure gallant set the fashion in the NUMs 
collections of letters and memoirs appeared and were filled with the intriguing new subject matter and the epistolary novel grew from this and led to the first full blown example of scandalous fiction in aphra behns love-letters between a nobleman and his sister NUM NUM NUM
before the rise of the literary novel reading novels had only been a form of entertainment 
however one of the earliest english novels daniel defoes robinson crusoe NUM has elements of the romance unlike these novels because of its exotic setting and story of survival in isolation 
crusoe lacks almost all of the elements found in these new novels wit a fast narration evolving around a group of young fashionable urban heroes along with their intrigues a scandalous moral gallant talk to be imitated and a brief conciseness plot 
the new developments did however lead to eliza haywoods epic length novel love in excess NUM and to samuel richardsons pamela or virtue rewarded NUM
some literary historians date the beginning of the english novel with richardsons pamela rather than crusoe 
the idea of the rise of the novel in the NUMth century is especially associated with ian watts important study the rise of the novel NUM
given these differences in opinion what happened in the NUMth century can best be described not as the rise of the novel but the rise of realism in fiction 
indeed this is what ian watt sees as distinguishing the novel from earlier prose narratives 
the rising status of the novel in NUMth-century can be seen in the development of philosophical and experimental novels 
philosophical fiction was not exactly new 
platos dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives and his republic is an early example of a utopia 
the tradition of works of fiction that were also philosophical texts continued with thomas mores utopia NUM and tommaso campanellas city of the sun NUM
however the tradition of the philosophical novel came into being in the NUMs with new editions of mores work under the title utopia or the happy republic a philosophical romance NUM
voltaire wrote in this genre in micromegas a comic romance which is a biting satire on philosophy ignorance and the self-conceit of mankind NUM english NUM
his zadig NUM and candide NUM became central texts of the french enlightenment and of the modern novel 
an example of the experimental novel is laurence sternes the life and opinions of tristram shandy gentleman NUM with its rejection of continuous narration 
in it the author not only addresses the reader in his preface but speaks directly to him or her in his fictional narrative 
in addition to sternes narrative experiments there has visual experiments such as a marbled page a black page to express sorrow and a page of lines to show the plot lines of the book 
the rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival the romance remained a spanish and english phenomenon and though readers all over western europe had welcomed the novella or short history as an alternative in the second half of the NUMth century only the english and the spanish had however openly discredited the romance 
but the change of taste was brief and fnelons telemachus NUM already exploited a nostalgia for the old romances with their heroism and professed virtue 
jane barker explicitly advertised her exilius as a new romance written after the manner of telemachus in NUM
robinson crusoe spoke of his own story as a romance though in the preface to the third volume published in NUM defoe attacks all who said that ... the story is feignd that the names are borrowd and that it is all a romance that there never were any such man or place
the late NUMth century brought an answer with the romantic movements readiness to reclaim the word romance especially with the gothic romance but the historical novels of walter scott also have a strong romance element 
robinson crusoe became a novel in this period appearing now as a work of the new realistic fiction that the NUMth century had created 
throughout the NUMth century romances continued to be written in britain by writers like emily bront and in america by the dark romantic novelists nathaniel hawthorne and herman melville 
sentimental novels relied on emotional responses and feature scenes of distress and tenderness and the plot is arranged to advance emotions rather than action 
the result is a valorization of fine feeling displaying the characters as models of refined sensitive emotional effect 
the ability to display such feelings was thought at this time to show character and experience and to help shape positive social life and relationships 
an example of this genre is samuel richardsons pamela or virtue rewarded NUM composed to cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the minds of the youth of both sexes which focuses on a potential victim a heroine that has all the modern virtues and who is vulnerable because her low social status and her occupation as servant of a libertine who falls in love with her 
she however ends in reforming her antagonist 
male heroes adopted the new sentimental character traits in the NUMs 
laurence sternes yorick the hero of the sentimental journey NUM did so with an enormous amount of humour 
oliver goldsmiths vicar of wakefield NUM and henry mackenzies man of feeling NUM produced the far more serious role models 
the virtuous production inspired a sub- and counterculture of pornographic novels 
greek and latin authors in modern translations had provided elegant transgressions on the market of the belles lettres for the last century 
satirical novels like richard heads english rogue NUM had led their heroes through urban brothels women authors like aphra behn had offered their heroines alternative careers as precursors of the NUMth-century femmes fataleswithout creating a subculture 
the market for belles lettres had been openly transgressive as long as it did not find any reflections in other media 
the new production beginning with works like john clelands fanny hill NUM differed in that it offered almost exact reversals of the plot lines the virtuous production demanded 
fanny hill is introduced to a life of prostitution learns to enjoy her part and establishes herself as a free and economically independent individual in editions one could only expect to buy under the counter 
openly uncontrollable conflicts arrived in the NUMs with johann wolfgang von goethes the sorrows of young werther NUM
the titular hero realised how impossible it had become for him to integrate into the new conformist society 
pierre choderlos de lacloss les liaisons dangereuses NUM shows the other extreme with a group of aristocrats playing games of intrigue and amorality 
by around NUM fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment and printed books had soon gained the power to reach readers of almost all classes though the reading habits differed and to follow fashions remained a privilege 
spain was a trendsetter into the NUMs but french authors superseded cervantes de quevedo and alemn in the NUMs 
as huet was to note in NUM the change was one of manners 
the new french works taught a new on the surface freer gallant exchange between the sexes as the essence of life at the french court 
the situation changed again from NUMs into the NUMs when works by french authors were published in holland out of the reach of french censors 
dutch publishing houses pirated of fashionable books from france and created a new market of political and scandalous fiction 
this led to a market of european rather than french fashions in the early NUMth century 
by the NUMs fashionable political european novels had inspired a second wave of private scandalous publications and generated new productions of local importance 
women authors reported on politics and on their private love affairs in the hague and in london 
german students imitated them to boast of their private amours in fiction 
the london the anonymous international market of the netherlands publishers in hamburg and leipzig generated new public spheres 
once private individuals such as students in university towns and daughters of londons upper class began write novels based on questionable reputations the public began to call for a reformation of manners 
reform became the main goal of the second generation of NUMth-century novelists who by the mid-century openly welcomed the change of climate that had first been promoted in journals such as the spectator
the spectator number NUM had stated that the aim was now to enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality  to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries schools and colleges to dwell in clubs and assemblies at tea-tables and coffeehouses
constructive criticism of novels had until then been rare 
the first treatise on the history of the novel was a preface to marie de la fayettes novel zayde NUM
new journals like the spectator and the tatler at the beginning of the century had reviews of novels 
new literary journals like gotthold ephraim lessings briefe die neuste literatur betreffend NUM appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction 
by the NUMs reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public 
a later development was the introduction of novels into school curricula and later that of universities 
the french churchman and scholar pierre daniel huets traitt de lorigine des romans NUM laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature in the early NUMth century 
the theologian had not only dared to praise fictions but he had also explained techniques of theological reading for the interpretation of fiction which was a novelty an individual could read novels and romances to gain insight into foreign and distant cultures as well as into his or her own culture 
the decades around NUM saw the appearance of new editions of petronius lucian and heliodorus of emesa 
the publishers equipped them with prefaces that referred to huets treatiseand the canon it had established 
exotic fictions entered the market that gave insight into the islamic mind 
furthermore the book of one thousand and one nights was first published in europe from NUM to NUM in french and then translated immediately into english and german and was seen as a contribution to huets history of romances 
new classics were added to the market and the english select collection of novels in six volumes NUM is a milestone in this development 
it included huets treatise along with the european tradition of the modern novel of the day that is novella from machiavellis to marie de la fayettes masterpieces 
aphra behns prose fictions had appeared as novels in the NUMs but when reprinted in collections her works became classics 
fnelons telemachus NUM became a classic within three years after its publication 
new authors now entered the market ready to use their own personal names as authors of fiction 
eliza haywood followed the footsteps of aphra behn when in NUM she used her name with unprecedented pride 
the very word romanticism is connected to the idea of romance and the romance genre experienced a revival at the end of the NUMth century with gothic fiction 
the origin of the gothic romance is attributed to english author horace walpole with his NUM novel the castle of otranto subtitled in its second edition a gothic story
other important works are ann radcliffes the mysteries of udolpho NUM and monk lewiss the monk NUM
the new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a realistic depictions of life and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish between serious classical art and popular fiction 
gothic romances exploited the grotesque and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of arthurian knighthood and that if the amadis had troubled don quixote with curious fantasies the new romantic tales were worse they described a nightmare world and explored sexual fantasies 
the authors of this new type of fiction could be and were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill arouse or horrify their audience 
these new romantic novelists at the same time claimed to explore the entire realm of fictionality 
new psychological interpreters in the early NUMth century read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination this included sexuality anxieties and insatiable desires 
under such psychological readings novels were described as exploring deeper human motives and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible 
the romances of de sade les NUM journes de sodome NUM poes tales of the grotesque and arabesque NUM mary shelley frankenstein NUM and e t a hoffmann die elixiere des teufels NUM would later attract NUMth-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for NUMth- and NUMst-century horror films love romances fantasy novels role-playing computer games and the surrealists 
the ancient romancers most commonly wrote fiction about the remote past with little attention to historical reality 
walter scotts historical novel waverley NUM broke with this earlier tradition of historical romance and he was the inventor of the true historical novel
at the same time he was a romantic and was influenced by gothic romance 
he had collaborated with the most famous of the gothic novelists monk lewis on tales of wonder in NUM
with his waverley novels scott hoped to do for the scottish border what goethe and other german poets had done for the middle ages and make its past live again in modern romance
scotts novels are in the mode he himself defined as romance the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents
he used his imagination to re-evaluate history by rendering things incidents and protagonists in the way only the novelist could do 
his work remained historical fiction yet it questioned existing historical perceptions 
the use of historical research was an important tool scott the novelist resorted to documentary sources as any historian would have done but as a romantic artist he gave his subject a deeper imaginative and emotional significance 
by combining research with marvelous and uncommon incidents scott attracted a far wider market than any historian could and he became the most famous novelist of his generation throughout europe 
in the NUMth century the relationship between authors publishers and readers changed 
most of the early NUMth-century fiction had been published anonymously 
authors had offered their manuscripts and received all the payment to be expected for the manuscript 
the new copyright laws introduced in the NUMth and NUMth centuries promised royalties on all future editions 
another change in the NUMth century was that novelists began to read their works in theaters halls and bookshops 
fiction was altered by these changes including the creation of more difficult works 
new novels also addressed openly current political and social issues which were being discussed in newspapers and magazines 
the idea of responsibility became a key issue whether of the citizen or of the artist 
the theoretical debate concentrated on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel on the integrity of individual artists as well as the claims of aesthetes like as oscar wilde and algernon charles swinburne who proposed the idea of art for arts sake
in this period the market for popular fiction grew and competed with works of literature 
new institutions like the circulating library create a new market with a mass reading public 
major british writers such as charles dickens and thomas hardy were influenced by the romance genre tradition of the novel 
the bront sisters were notable mid-NUMth-century creators in this tradition with anne bronts the tenant of wildfell hall charlotte bronts jane eyre and emily bronts wuthering heights
publishing at the very end of the NUMth century joseph conrad has been called a supreme romancer
in america the romance  .. proved to be a serious flexible and successful medium for the exploration of philosophical ideas and attitudes 
notable examples include nathaniel hawthornes the scarlet letter and herman melvilles moby-dick
a number of european novelists were influenced during this period by the earlier romantic movement including victor hugo with novels like the hunchback of notre-dame NUM and les misrables NUM and mikhail yuryevich lermontov with a hero of our time NUM
many NUMth-century authors dealt with significant social matters 
mile zolas novels depicted the world of the working classes which marx and engelss non-fiction explores 
in the united states slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin NUM which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract 
charles dickens novels led his readers into contemporary workhouses and provided first-hand accounts of child labor 
the treatment of the subject of war changed with leo tolstoys war and peace NUM where he questions the facts provided by historians 
similarly the treatment of crime is very different in fyodor dostoyevskys crime and punishment NUM where the point of view is that of a criminal 
women authors had dominated fiction from the NUMs into the early NUMth century but few before george eliot so openly questioned the role education and status of women in society as she did 
as the novel became a platform of modern debate national literatures were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the historical novel 
alessandro manzonis i promessi sposi NUM did this for italy while novelists in russia and the surrounding slavonic countries as well as scandinavia did likewise 
along with this new appreciation of history the future also became a topic for fiction 
this had been done earlier in works like samuel maddens memoirs of the twentieth century NUM and mary shelleys the last man NUM a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague 
edward bellamys looking backward NUM and h g wellss the time machine NUM were concerned with technological and biological developments 
industrialization darwins theory of evolution and marxs theory of class divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate 
bellamys looking backward became the second best-selling book of the NUMth century after harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin
such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular science fiction as the NUMth century approached 
james joyces ulysses NUM had a major influence on modern novelists in the way that it replaced the NUMth- and NUMth-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts a stream of consciousness
this term was first used by william james in NUM and is used or the related interior monologue by modernists like dorothy richardson marcel proust as well as later virginia woolf and william faulkner 
also in the NUMs expressionist alfred dblin went in a different direction with berlin alexanderplatz NUM where interspersed non-fictional text fragments exist alongside the fictional material to create another new form of realism which differs from that of stream-of-consciousness 
later works like samuel becketts trilogy molloy NUM malone dies NUM and the unnamable NUM as well as julio cortzars rayuela NUM and thomas pynchons gravitys rainbow NUM all make use of the stream-of-consciousness technique 
on the other hand robert coover is an example of those authors who the NUMs fragmented their stories and challenged time and sequentiality as fundamental structural concepts 
the NUMth century novels deals with a wide range of subject matter 
erich maria remarques all quiet on the western front NUM focusses on young germans experiences of world war i 
the jazz age is explored by american f scott fitzgerald and the great depression by fellow american john steinbeck 
the rise of totalitarian states is the subject of british writer george orwell 
frances existentialism is the subject of french writers jean-paul sartres nausea NUM and albert camus the stranger NUM
the counterculture of the NUMs led to revived interest in hermann hesses steppenwolf NUM and produced such iconic works of its own like ken keseys one flew over the cuckoos nest and thomas pynchons gravitys rainbow
novelist have also been interested in the subject of racial and gender identity in recent decades 
jesse kavadlo of maryville university of st louis has described chuck palahniuks fight club NUM as a closeted feminist critique
virginia woolf simone de beauvoir doris lessing elfriede jelinek were feminist voices during this period 
furthermore the major political and military confrontations of the NUMth and NUMst centuries have also influenced novelists 
the events of world war ii from a german perspective are dealt with by gnter grass the tin drum NUM and an american by joseph hellers catch-NUM NUM
the subsequent cold war influenced popular spy novels 
latin american self-awareness in the wake of the failing left revolutions of the NUMs and NUMs resulted in a latin american boom linked to with the names of novelists julio cortzar mario vargas llosa carlos fuentes and gabriel garca mrquez along with the invention of a special brand of postmodern magic realism 
another major NUMth-century social events the so-called sexual revolution is reflected in the modern novel 
d h lawrences lady chatterleys lover had to be published in italy in NUM british censorship lifted its ban as late as NUM
henry millers tropic of cancer NUM created the comparable us scandal 
transgressive fiction from vladimir nabokovs lolita NUM to michel houellebecqs les particules lmentaires NUM entered a literary field that eventually led to more pornographic works such as anne desclos story of o NUM to anas nins delta of venus NUM
in the second half of the NUMth century postmodern authors subverted serious debate with playfulness claiming that art could never be original that it always plays with existing materials 
the idea that language is self-referential was already an accepted truth in the world of pulp fiction 
a postmodernist re-reads popular literature as an essential cultural production 
novels from thomas pynchons the crying of lot NUM NUM to umberto ecos the name of the rose NUM and foucaults pendulum NUM made use of intertextual references 
see also thriller westerns and speculative fiction

the historic advantage of genres is to allow the direct marketing of fiction 
while the reader of so-called elitist literature will follow public discussions of novels the popular production has to employ the traditionally more direct and short-term marketing strategies with the open declarations of their content 
the most popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name 
ie 
the sherlock holmes series by arthur conan doyle

popular literature holds the largest market share 
romance fiction had an estimated NUM.NUMbillion share in the us book market in NUM
inspirational literaturereligious literature followed with NUMmillion science fictionfantasy with NUMmillion mystery with NUMmillion and then classic literary fiction with NUMmillion 
popular literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern chapbook 
both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction 
the NUMth-century love romance is a successor of the novels madeleine de scudry marie de la fayette aphra behn and eliza haywood wrote from the NUMs into the NUMs 
the modern adventure novel goes back to daniel defoes robinson crusoe NUM and its immediate successors 
modern pornography has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and hedonistic belles lettres of works like john clelands fanny hill NUM and similar eighteenth century novels 
ian flemings james bond is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in la guerre despagne NUM
marion zimmer bradleys the mists of avalon is influenced by tolkien as well as arthurian literature including its NUMth-century successors 
modern horror fiction also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early-NUMth-century romantic literature 
modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history from the NUMs 
the authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature 
dan brown for example discusses on his website the question whether his da vinci code is an anti-christian novel 
and because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve they can risk offending literary critic 
however the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years with postmodernism and poststructuralism as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries 
crime became a major subject of NUMth and NUMst century genre novelists and crime fiction reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies 
crime is personal and public subject criminals each have their personal motivations detectives see their moral codes challenged 
patricia highsmiths thrillers became a medium of new psychological explorations 
paul austers new york trilogy NUM is an example of experimental postmodernist literature based on this genre 
fantasy has become a major area of commercial fiction 
a major example is j r r tolkiens the lord of the rings NUM a work that grew from a book written for young readers into a major cultural artefact 
tolkien revived european epic literature in the tradition of beowulf and the north germanic edda and the arthurian cycles 
science fiction has developed a variety of genres from the early technological adventure jules verne had made fashionable in the NUMs to a novel like aldous huxleys brave new world NUM about western consumerism and technology 
george orwells nineteen eighty-four NUM deals with totalitarianism and surveillance among other matters while stanisaw lem isaac asimov and arthur c clarke produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines 
the surreal novels of philip k dick such as the three stigmata of palmer eldritch explore the nature of reality reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the NUMs and NUMs 
writers such as ursula le guin and margaret atwood explore feminist and broader social issues in their works 
william gibson author of the cult classic neuromancer NUM is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and virtual reality 
pbs

the public broadcasting service pbs is an american public broadcaster and television program distributor 
it is a non-profit organization and is the most prominent provider of government-funded educational television programming to public television stations in the united states distributing series such as keeping up appearances bbc world news as bbc world news america since NUM nova sciencenow nova arthur sesame street pbs newshour walking with dinosaurs masterpiece nature rick steves europe american masters frontline and antiques roadshow
pbs is funded by member station dues the corporation for public broadcasting government agencies corporations foundations and individual citizens 
all proposed funding is subjected to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source 
since the mid-NUMs roper polls commissioned by pbs have consistently placed the service as the most-trusted national institution in the united states 
however pbs is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations a large proportion of which including most specials aired during pledge drives come from affiliates including such member stations as wgbh weta-tv wnet wttw national productions american public television and independent producers 
this arbitrary distinction is a frequent source of viewer confusion 
the service has more than NUM member television stations many owned by educational institutions by non-profit groups affiliated with a local public school district or collegiate educational institution or by state government-owned or state government-related entities 
it also operates national datacast ndi a subsidiary which offers datacasting services via member stations and provides additional revenue for pbs and its member stations 
founded by hartford n gunn jr  pbs began operations on october NUM NUM taking over many of the functions of its predecessor national educational television net which later merged with newark new jersey station wndt to form wnet 
in NUM it merged with educational television stations 
unlike the five major commercial broadcast television networks in the united states abc cbs nbc fox and the cw  which compensate their affiliate stations to carry their programs  pbs is not a network but a program distributor that provides television content and related services to its member stations 
each station is charged with the responsibility of programming local content often news interview cultural and public affairs programs for their individual market or state that supplements content provided by pbs and other public television distributors 
in a television network structure affiliates give up portions of their local advertising airtime in exchange for carrying network programming and the network pays its affiliates a share of the revenue it earns from advertising although this structure has been reversed in recent years with the network compensated by the stations
by contrast pbs member stations pay fees for the shows acquired and distributed by the national organization 
under this relationship pbs member stations have greater latitude in local scheduling than their commercial broadcasting counterparts 
scheduling of pbs-distributed series may vary greatly depending on the market 
this can be a source of tension as stations seek to preserve their localism and pbs strives to market a consistent national lineup 
however pbs has a policy of common carriage which requires most stations to clear the national prime time programs on a common programming schedule to market them nationally more effectively 
management at former los angeles member kcet cited unresolvable financial and programming disputes among its major reasons for leaving pbs after over NUM years in january NUM
although pbs has a set schedule of programming particularly in regard to its prime time schedule while many members carry a feed of night-time programming from the pbs satellite service member stations reserve the right to schedule pbs-distributed programming in other time slots or not clear it at all if they choose to do so few of the services members carry all its programming 
most pbs stations timeshift some distributed programs 
once pbs accepts a program offered for distribution pbs rather than the originating member station retains exclusive rebroadcasting rights during an agreed period 
suppliers retain the right to sell the program in non-broadcast media such as dvds books and sometimes pbs licensed merchandise but sometimes grant such ancillary rights as well to pbs
in NUM the corporation for public broadcasting resumed production for most pbs shows that debuted prior to NUM with the exceptions of washington week in review and wall street week cpb resumed production of washington week in NUM
in NUM the chronicle of philanthropy released the results of the largest study on the popularity and credibility of charitable and non-profit organizations 
pbs ranked as the NUMth most popular charitynon-profit in america from over NUM charities researched in the study conducted by the industry publication with NUM.NUM of americans over the age of NUM choosing love and like a lot for pbs 
in december NUM pbs signed up for the nielsen ratings audience measurement reports and began to be included in its primetime and daily television index reports alongside the major commercial broadcast networks 
in may NUM pbs announced that it would incorporate breaks containing underwriter spots for corporate and foundation sponsors program promotions and identification spots within four breaks placed within episodes of nature and nova airing episodes broken up into segments of up to NUM minutes rather than airing them as straight NUM- to NUM-minute episodes 
the strategy began that fall with the intent to expand the in-program breaks to the remainder of the schedule if successful 
in NUM pbs released apps for ios and android to allow viewing of full-length videos on mobile devices 
an update in NUM added chromecast support 
on february NUM NUM pbs partnered with aol to launch makers a digital documentary series focusing on high-achieving women in male-dominated industries such as war comedy space business hollywood and politics 
pbs initially struggled to compete with online media such as youtube for market share 
in a NUM speech to NUM top executives from pbs stations senior vice president of digital jason seiken warned that pbs was in danger of being disrupted by youtube studios such as maker studios 
in the speech later described as a seminal moment for public television he laid out his vision for a new style of pbs digital video production 
station leadership rallied around his vision and seiken formed pbs digital studios which began producing educational but edgy videos something seiken called pbs-quality with a youtube sensibility 
the studios first hit an auto-tuned version of the theme from one of their most famous television programs mister rogers neighborhood was one of youtubes NUM most viral videos of NUM
by NUM monthly video views on pbsorg had risen from NUM million to a quarter-billion pbsorg traffic had surpassed that of the cbs nbc and abc web sites pbskidsorg had become the dominant us childrens site for video and pbs had won more NUM webby awards than any other media company in the world 
on may NUM NUM full-length episodes of pbs prime time news and childrens programs were made available through the roku streaming player programming is available on roku as separate streaming channels for pbs and pbs kids content 
the evening and primetime schedule on pbs features a diverse array of programming including fine arts great performances drama masterpiece downton abbey american family journey of dreams science nova nature history american experience american masters history detectives antiques roadshow music austin city limits soundstage public affairs frontline pbs newshour washington week nightly business report independent films and documentaries po v 
 independent lens home improvement this old house and interviews amanpour on pbs tavis smiley the dick cavett show
in NUM pbs began organizing much of its prime time programming around a genre-based schedule for example drama series encompass the sunday schedule while science-related programs are featured on wednesdays
pbs broadcasts childrens programming as part of the services and including content supplied by other distributors not programmed by the service its member stations morning and afternoon schedule 
as the childrens programs it distributes are intended to educate as well as entertain its target audience pbs and its stations have long been in compliance with educational programming guidelines set by the federal communications commission in response to the enactment of the childrens television act of NUM
many member stations have historically also broadcast distance education and other instructional television programs typically during daytime slots though with the advent of digital television which has allowed stations to carry these programs on digital subchannels in lieu of the main pbs feed or exclusively over the internet many member stationsnetworks have replaced distance education content with childrens and other programming 
unlike its radio counterpart national public radio pbs does not have a central program production arm or news division 
all of the programming carried by pbs whether news documentary or entertainment is created by or in most cases produced under contract with other parties such as individual member stations 
boston member wgbh-tv is one of the largest producers of educational television programming including shows like american experience arthur masterpiece theatre nova antiques roadshow and frontline as well as many other childrens and lifestyle programs 
news programs are produced by weta-tv pbs newshour in washington dc  wnet in new york city and wpbt in miami 
newark new jerseynew york city member wnet produces or distributes programs such as secrets of the dead nature and cyberchase
pbs also works with other networks for programming such as cnn international for amanpour on pbs
pbs member stations are known for rebroadcasting british television costume dramas comedies and science fiction programs acquired from the bbc and other sources such as downton abbey allo allo
 are you being served
 the benny hill show red dwarf the fall and rise of reginald perrin father ted fawlty towers harry enfield and chums keeping up appearances monty pythons flying circus mr bean the vicar of dibley doctor who and sherlock consequently this has led to jocular references that the services name stands for primarily british series
however a significant amount of sharing takes place 
the bbc and british broadcasters such as channel NUM often cooperate with pbs stations producing material that is shown on both sides of the atlantic 
less frequently canadian australian and other international programming appears on pbs stations such as the red green show currently distributed by syndicator executive program services public broadcasting syndicators are more likely to offer this programming to us -based public television stations 
rerun programming is generally uncommon on pbs or its member stations with some exceptions 
the lawrence welk show has aired continuously in reruns on pbs through the oklahoma educational television authority almost every weekend since NUM
other programs that have been aired in reruns are generally past pbs series whose hosts have retired or are now deceased for example the joy of painting and mister rogers neighborhood or have simply ended production such as dragonflytv and clifford the big red dog
launched in NUM as ptv pbs kids is the brand for childrens programs aired by pbs 
the pbs kids network which was launched in NUM and operated until NUM was largely funded by satellite provider directv 
the channel ceased operations on october NUM NUM in favor of pbs kids sprout a commercial digital cable and satellite television channel originally operated as a joint venture with comcast sesame workshop and apax partners nbcuniversal which comcast acquired in NUM later acquired the other partners interests in the channel in NUM
however the original programming block still exists on pbs filling daytime and in some cases weekend morning schedules on its member stations many members also carry NUM-hour locally programmed childrens networks featuring pbs kids content on one of their digital subchannels 
as of NUM pbs kids kidsclick and mitelemundo are currently only three childrens programming blocks on us commercial broadcast television 
as pbs is often known for doing pbs kids has broadcast imported series from other countries these include british series originally broadcast by the bbc and itv such as rosie and jim tots tv teletubbies boohbah and thomas the tank engine  friends as well as several canadian programs such as theodore tugboat
through american public television many pbs stations also began airing the australian series raggs on june NUM NUM
some of the programs broadcast as part of the services childrens lineup or through public broadcast syndication directly to its members have subsequently been syndicated to commercial television outlets such as ghostwriter and the magic school bus
many pbs member stations and networks  including mississippi public broadcasting mhsaa georgia public broadcasting ghsa maine public broadcasting network mpa iowa public television ighsau nebraska educational telecommunications nsaa and wkyu-tv western kentucky hilltoppers  locally broadcast high school and college sports 
from the NUMs onward the national pbs network has not typically carried sporting events mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential in addition starting with the respective launches of the mountainwest sports network now defunct and big ten network in NUM and NUM and the later launches of the pac-NUM network and espns sec network athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member universitys sports programs for their cable channels restricting their use from pbs member stations even those associated with their own universities 
from NUM to NUM kqed produced a series of bundesliga matches under the banner soccer made in germany with toby charles announcing 
pbs also carried tennis events as well as ivy league football 
notable football commentators included upton bell marty glickman bob casciola brian dowling sean mcdonough and jack corrigan 
other sports programs included interview series such as the way it was and the sporting life
the board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for pbs consisting of NUM members NUM professional directors station managers NUM general directors outside directors and the pbs president 
all pbs board members serve three-year terms without pay 
pbs member stations elect the NUM professional directors the board elects the NUM general directors and appoints the pbs president and ceo and the entire board elects its officers 
 pbs maintains current memberships with NUM television stations encompassing NUM states the district of columbia and four us possessions as such it is the only television broadcaster in the united states  commercial or non-commercial  which has station partners licensed in every us state by comparison none of the five major commercial broadcast networks has affiliates in certain states where pbs has members most notably new jersey
the service has an estimated national reach of NUM.NUM of all households in the united states or NUM americans with at least one television set
pbs stations are commonly operated by nonprofit organizations state agencies local authorities such as municipal boards of education or universities in their city of license this is similar albeit more centralized in states where a licensee owns multiple stations rebroadcasting the main pbs member to the early model of commercial broadcasting in the us  in which network-affiliated stations were initially owned by companies that owned few to no other television stations elsewhere in the country 
in some us states a group of pbs stations throughout the entire state may be organized into a single regional subnetwork such as alabama public television and the arkansas educational television network in this model pbs programming and other content is distributed by the originating station in the subnetwork to other full-power stations that serve as satellites as well as any low-power translators in other areas of the state 
some states may be served by such a regional network and simultaneously have pbs member stations in a certain city such as the case with secondary member kbdi-tv in denver which is not related to colorado member network rocky mountain pbs and its flagship station and primary denver pbs member krma-tv that operate autonomously from the regional member network 
as opposed to the present commercial broadcasting model in which network programs are often carried exclusively on one television station in a given market pbs may maintain more than one member station in certain markets which may be owned by the licensee of the markets primary pbs member station or owned by a separate licensee as a prime example koce-tv klcs and kvcr-dt  which are all individually owned  serve as pbs stations for the los angeles market kcet served as the markets primary pbs member until it left the service in january NUM at which time it was replaced by koce
for these cases pbs utilizes the program differentiation plan which divides by percentage the amount of programs distributed by the service that each member can carry on their schedule often this assigns a larger proportion of pbs-distributed programming to the primary member station with the secondary members being allowed to carry a lesser amount of program offerings from the services schedule 
unlike public broadcasters in most other countries pbs cannot own any of the stations that broadcasts its programming therefore it is one of the few television programming bodies that does not have any owned-and-operated stations 
this is partly due to the origins of the pbs stations themselves and partly due to historical broadcast license issues 
most pbs member stations have produced at least some nationally distributed programs 
current regularly scheduled programming on the pbs national feed is produced by a smaller group of stations including

pbs has spun off a number of television networks often in partnership with other media companies 
pbs you a distance education and how-to service operated until january NUM and was largely succeeded by create a similarly formatted network owned by american public television pbs kids channel was superseded by sprout at the start of october NUM
the pbs kids channel relaunched january NUM NUM
world began operations in NUM as a service operated by pbs but is now managed by american public television 
pbs has also restructured its satellite feed system simplifying pbs-dtNUM into a timeshift feed for the pacific time zone rather than a high-definition complement to its formerly primary sd feed 
pbs kids go
was proposed as a replacement broadcast network for pbs kids channel however plans to launch the network were folded in NUM
programming from the pbs satellite service has also been carried by certain member stations or regional member networks as a placeholder feed to fill their overnight schedules particularly those that have transitioned to a NUM-hour schedule since the late NUMs in lieu of providing their own programming sourced by outside public television distributors and repeats of local programming program promotions shown on the satellite feed advertise upcoming programs as being aired on pbs during the timeslot card normally used as a placeholder for member outlets to insert local airtime information during their station breaks
some or all of these services are available on the digital cable tiers of many cable providers on free-to-air fta television via c-band satellite as well as via direct broadcast satellite 
with the exception of sprout some of these services including those from pbs member stations and networks have not made contracts with internet-distributed over-the-top mvpd services such as playstation vue and sling tv 
with the transition to over-the-air digital television broadcasts many of the services are also often now available as standard-definition multicast channels on the digital signals of some member stations while pbs-dtNUM serves as a secondary hd feed 
with the absence of advertising network identification on these pbs networks was limited to utilization at the end of the program which includes the standard series of bumpers from the be more campaign 
while not operated or controlled by pbs proper additional public broadcasting networks are available and carried by pbs member stations 
from NUM to NUM buffalo new york member station wned-tv operated thinkbright tv a service that was carried on several stations in upstate new york 
a separate but related concept is the state network where a group of stations across a state simulcast a single programming schedule from a central facility which may include specialty subchannels unique to that broadcaster 
since NUM to NUM of public televisions revenues come from private membership donations and grants most stations solicit individual donations by methods including fundraising pledge drives or telethons which disrupt regularly scheduled programming 
this has been perceived as potentially annoying since regularly scheduled programming is often replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience such as music specials aimed at the baby boomer generation and financial health and motivational programs to solicit new members and donations during fundraising events these programs are often interrupted within the broadcast by long-form segments of six to eight minutes in length encouraging viewers to donate to their pbs member 
underwriting spots are aired at the end of each program which differ from traditional commercials in several ways 
each spot must be approved to meet several guidelines 
the main guidelines state that underwriting spots cannot be qualitative in any way nor can they have any call to action 
a NUM broadcast of the united states information agency program let poland be poland about the martial law declared in poland in NUM was widely viewed in the us  but met with skepticism on the part of eastern european broadcasters communist countries at the time due to concerns that the programs provocative and anticommunist tone was intended as propaganda 
in NUM at least three public television stations were caught selling or trading their mailing lists with the democratic national committee 
under irs regulations nonprofit organizations are prohibited from participating in political actions 
officials from the corporation for public broadcasting condemned the practice and conducted an investigation into the matter 
the stations involved were in new york boston and washington 
individual programs aired by pbs have been the targets of organized campaigns by individuals and groups with opposing views including former united states secretary of education margaret spellings 
bill moyers resigned in NUM after more than three decades as a pbs regular citing political pressure to alter the content of his program and saying chairman of the board of the corporation for public broadcasting kenneth tomlinson had mounted a vendetta against him 
moyers eventually returned to host bill moyers journal after tomlinsons resignation from cpb 
subsequently pbs made room temporarily for rightwing commentator tucker carlson formerly of msnbc and co-host of cnns crossfire and the journal editorial report with paul gigot an editor of the wall street journal editorial page this program has since moved to fox news channel to partially balance out the perceived left-leaning pbs shows 
in the NUMs pbs became involved in a dispute over home video licensing rights with pacific arts corporation a multimedia company owned and operated by former monkees guitarist michael nesmith 
in NUM pacific arts secured a contract with pbs to distribute their back catalog of programming on vhs under the pbs home video banner 
however in the early NUMs pacific arts and pbs went through a series of serious disagreements 
lawsuits were filed by nesmith and pacific arts against pbs for breach of contract intentional misrepresentation intentional concealment negligent misrepresentation and interference with contract and by pbs against nesmith and pacific arts for lost royalties 
the lawsuits escalated in NUM and NUM into major litigation between the parties over these rights and payments 
pbs and nesmith and pacific arts vigorously prosecuted these multimillion-dollar counter-suits 
the six plaintiffs included pbs wgbh wnet the ken burns-owned american documentaries and radio pioneers film project and the childrens television workshop 
they sought approximately NUM million in disputed royalties advances guarantees and license fees for programs and the use of the pbs logo from the defendants pacific arts and nesmith 
due to the cost of the litigation pacific arts was forced to cease distribution operations and suspended the use of the pbs logo on the pacific arts videos 
though pacific arts distribution system had ceased operating the various plaintiffs were counting on capturing a personal financial guarantee nesmith had made to pbs in the original pbs deal in NUM
the cases went to jury trial in federal court in los angeles in february NUM
after three days of deliberation the jury unanimously sided with nesmith 
the court awarded pacific arts NUM for loss of its rights library plus NUM in punitive damages 
the jury awarded NUM million to nesmith personally including NUM million in punitive damages for a total award to nesmith and pacific arts of NUM
the jury resolved the outstanding license fee issues by ordering pacific arts and nesmith to pay approximately NUM.NUM million to american documentaries for the civil war about NUM to wgbh and NUM to wnet 
following the ruling nesmith expressed his personal disappointment with pbs and was quoted by bbc news as stating its like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo 
youre happy to get your stereo back but its sad to find out your grandmother is a thief 
the decision never went to an appeals court and the final amount paid to pacific arts and nesmith was an undisclosed sum agreed to in an out-of-court settlement

the novel has elements of humor satire and social criticism features that later made mark twain one of the most important authors of american literature 
mark twain describes some autobiographical events in the book 
the novel is set around twains actual boyhood home of hannibal near st louis and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result 
tom sawyer is twains first attempt to write a novelon his own 
he had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives the innocents abroad or the new pilgrims progress roughing it and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time 
these are the story of the good boy and the story of the wicked little boy which are satirical texts of a few pages 
in the first a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared 
in the second story an evil little boy steals and lies like tom sawyer but finishes rich and successful 
tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity 
by the time he wrote tom sawyer twain was already a successful author based on the popularity of the innocents abroad 
he owned a large house in hartford connecticut but needed another success to support himself with a wife and two daughters 
he had collaborated on a novel with charles dudley warner  published in NUM
he had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the mississippi and corresponded with a boyhood friend will bowenthat had evoked many memories and was used as a source of material 
twain named his fictional character after a san francisco fireman whom he met in june NUM
the real tom sawyer was a local hero famous for rescuing NUM passengers after a shipwreck 
the two remained friendly during twains three-year stay in san francisco often drinking and gambling together 
in november NUM twain gave the manuscript to elisha bliss of the american publishing company who sent it to true williams for the illustrations 
a little later twain had the text also quickly published at chatto and windus of london in june NUM but without illustration 
pirate editions appeared very quickly in canada and germany 
the american publishing company finally published its edition in december NUM which was the first illustrated edition of tom sawyer 
these two editions differ slightly 
after completing his manuscript twain had a copy made of it 
it is this copy which was read and annotated by his friend william dean howells 
twain then made his own corrections based on howells comments which he later incorporated in the original manuscript but some corrections escaped him 
the english edition was based on this corrected copy while the illustrated american edition was based on the original manuscript 
to further complicate matters twain was personally concerned with the revision of the proofs of the american edition which he did not do for the english edition 
the american edition is therefore considered the authoritative edition 
a third person narrator describes the experiences of the boys interspersed with occasional social commentary 
in its sequel huckleberry finn mark twain changes to a first person narrative which takes moral conflicts more personally and thus makes greater social criticism possible 
sometimes the book is described as racist because black people are called niggers in the text 
this was common practice at the time and does not necessarily indicate racism 
a cleansed version which no longer contained the word aroused indignation among some literary critics 
tom sawyer the storys title character also appears in two other uncompleted sequels huck and tom among the indians and tom sawyers conspiracy
he is also a character in twains unfinished schoolhouse hill.

as the book begins gertie nevels a kentucky mountain woman is struggling to take her sick child down the mountain to see a doctor

the boy recovers 
during the next part of the book we get a glimpse of gerties life in the mountains where she is close to her husband clovis her five children her parents and the community 
she is very much at home and fulfilled in this environment surrounded by nature and connected with the people she loves 
she is extremely competent in this mountain life 
she thoroughly knows the bible 
among her many talents is a particular gift for whittling which she uses to make practical items like ax handles and creative work like dolls 
she is gradually carving a sculpture out of a large block of cherry wood although she does not know if the figure which will eventually emerge will be christ or judas 
her dream is to buy the old tipton place for the family so they will have a better home and can farm for themselves rather than as sharecroppers 
but the war is intruding on this peaceful life 
men from the community are fighting overseas gerties brother has just been killed in the war and cloviss coal delivery business is suffering 
then clovis is called into the military induction center 
not drafted clovis goes instead to detroit to do war work in the factories 
unbeknownst to clovis after years of careful saving and with some money inherited from her brother gertie buys the tipton place and begins to move the family into their new home 
but word soon reaches her that clovis is expecting them to join him in detroit 
under pressure from her mother gertie is convinced to give up the tipton place 
she gets her money back and prepares to go with her children to detroit to join clovis who knew nothing about the home purchase 
giving up her dream of the home is a heartbreaking loss for gertie but at least she expects life will be better for her children in detroit 
when they arrive in detroit however they find that life is in many ways worse for them 
the wartime housing project apartment is small and the neighborhood industrial 
the schools are bad and the winter is hard the food poor 
money is short and the family must often borrow to buy necessities 
there is not always enough food to feed the family 
she begins to waiver in her christian faith 
cloviss work can be unsteady 
gertie develops some new friends among the other women in the housing project and she finds that she is able to sell her carvings which helps them get by 
later gertie reluctantly lets clovis convince her to use an electric saw to make the dolls to increase her sales even though these machine-made dolls are ugly compared to her beautiful hand-carved dolls 
although their new life is in many ways unpleasant gertie and clovis do their best to adapt 
they are completely out of place in this setting though and the family begins to suffer more and more serious problems 
first her oldest boy runs away to return to the mountains 
then her beloved daughter cassie a sensitive child who simply cannot adapt to the new life is killed by a train in an accident indirectly caused by gerties well-meaning but misguided efforts to try to help cassie fit in 
then her husband is increasingly drawn into union battles clovis first a victim and eventually a perpetrator of serious strike-related violence 
at last gertie sacrifices the large wooden sculpture she has been working on throughout the book 
at a moment of particular financial distress she cuts up the sculpture for wood to make dolls for sale to help support her family 
the style of this novel has been characterized as social realism for its realistic depictions of working class life 
in a NUM interview arnow said she got to know many back hills women while teaching in a one-room kentucky school 
later arnow moved to a housing project in detroit 
this was during the appalachian migration which saw huge numbers of mountain people moving north to work in war-related automobile manufacturing and other industries 
however in this interview arnow stressed that the dollmaker story was in no way autobiographical 
rather she said the story was created in her imagination 
the dollmaker is a NUM american made-for-television drama film starring jane fonda and based on the novel
