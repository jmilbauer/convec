She is known for her two best-selling novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', and for developing a philosophical system she called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, ''The Fountainhead''. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel ''Atlas Shrugged''. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]] and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.

Rand advocated [[reason]] as the only means of acquiring [[knowledge]] and rejected faith and religion. She supported [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] and rejected [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. In politics, she condemned the [[initiation of force]] as immoral<ref>{{harvnb|Barry|1987|p=122}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=309–314}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=298}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=46}}.</ref> and opposed [[collectivism]] and [[statism]] as well as [[anarchism]], instead supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], which she defined as the system based on recognizing [[individual rights]], including property rights.<ref name="rights">{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|pp=91–92}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=379–380}}.</ref> In art, Rand promoted [[romantic realism]].

Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews<ref name="Gladstein 117-119">{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=117–119}}</ref> and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades.<ref name="growing">{{harvnb|Cohen|2001}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Marcus|2009}}</ref><ref name="Badhwar 2010">{{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}.</ref> The [[Objectivist movement]] attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.<ref name="reception">{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}.</ref> She has been a significant influence among [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]].<ref name="politicalinfluence">{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=107–108, 124}}.</ref>

==Life==

===Early life===
Rand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum ({{lang-ru|Али́са Зиновьевна Розенбаум}}) on February 2, 1905 to a Russian Jewish [[bourgeois]] family living in [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=xiii}}.</ref> She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan), largely non-observant Jews. Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist who owned a pharmacy and the building in which it was located.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=3–5}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=9}}.</ref> Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=68}}.</ref> At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the [[Nabokov house|Nabokov mansion]]: while Nabokova defended [[constitutional monarchy]], Rand supported [[republicanism|republican ideals]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=69, 367–368}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=2}}.</ref>

She was twelve at the time of the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, during which she favored [[Alexander Kerensky]] over [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]]. The subsequent [[October Revolution]] and the rule of the [[Bolshevik]]s under [[Vladimir Lenin]] disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the [[Crimean Peninsula]], which was initially under control of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. While in high school, Rand decided that she was an [[atheist]] and valued [[reason]] above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=35–39}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=14–20}}.</ref>

[[File:Spb 06-2012 University Embankment 06.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The Twelve Collegia of what was then Petrograd State University|Rand completed a three-year program at [[Petrograd State University]].]]
After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at [[Petrograd State University]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=15}}.</ref> At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of [[social pedagogy]], majoring in history.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=77}}.</ref> At the university she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]],<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|pp=5–8}}.</ref> who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=451–460}}.</ref> She also studied the philosophical works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17–18, 22–24}}.</ref> Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]], who became her perennial favorites.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}}.</ref>

Along with many other bourgeois students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=24}}.</ref> which Rand did in October 1924.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1999|p=1}}.</ref> She then studied for a year at the State [[Tekhnikum|Technicum]] for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment she wrote an essay about the Polish actress [[Pola Negri]], which became her first published work.<ref name="Heller49-50">{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=49–50}}.</ref>

By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=33}}.</ref> possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt {{lang|ru|Рзнб}} of her birth surname in [[Cyrillic]] handwriting,<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=55}}.</ref> and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'', either from a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] name ''[[Aino (given name)|Aino]]'' or from the [[Hebrew]] word {{lang|he| עין}} (''[[ayin]]'', meaning "eye").{{efn|Rand said the origin of ''Ayn'' was Finnish,<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1995b|p=40}}.</ref> but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=55–57}}.</ref>}}

===Arrival in the United States===
[[File:Pola Negri by Ayn Rand cover.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A brown book cover with black-and-white drawings and text in Russian. The drawing on the left is a portrait of a woman with dark hair; the drawing on the right is of skyscrapers.|Cover of Rand's first published work, a 2,500-word monograph on actress [[Pola Negri]] published in 1925<ref name="Heller49-50"/>]]
In late 1925, Rand was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit relatives in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=32}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=18–19}}.</ref> She departed on January 17, 1926.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–51}}.</ref> When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of [[Manhattan]] that she cried what she later called "tears of splendor".<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=53}}.</ref> Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then left for [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=57–60}}.</ref>

In Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to work as an [[Extra (drama)|extra]] in his film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=34–36}}.</ref> While working on ''The King of Kings'', she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. She became a [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent American resident]] in July 1929 and [[United States nationality law#Naturalization|an American citizen]] on March 3, 1931.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=71}}.</ref> Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=35–40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=74, 81, 84}}.</ref> She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=96–98}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=43–44, 52}}.</ref>

===Early fiction===
{{see also|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}
Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' to [[Universal Studios]] in 1932, although it was never produced.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}.</ref> This was followed by the courtroom drama ''[[Night of January 16th]]'', first produced by [[E. E. Clive]] in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on the jury's vote, one of two different endings would be performed.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=76, 92}}.</ref> In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a [[The Night of January 16th (film)|movie loosely based on the play]]. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=78}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=87}}.</ref> ''[[Ideal (novel)|Ideal]]'' is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate. The heroine is an actress who embodies Randian ideals.<ref name=NYT81015>{{harvnb|Kakutani|2015}}.</ref>

Rand's first published novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936. Set in [[Soviet Russia]], it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that ''We the Living'' "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not ..."<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1995a|p=xviii}}.</ref> Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print,<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=13}}.</ref> although European editions continued to sell.<ref>Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=141}}.</ref> After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies.<ref>Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|p=143}}.</ref> In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira''. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''[[We the Living (film)|We the Living]]'' in 1986.<ref>{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}.</ref>

Her novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, ''The Fountainhead''. It presents a vision of a [[dystopian]] future world in which [[totalitarian]] collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=102}}.</ref> It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with ''We the Living'', Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5&nbsp;million copies.<ref>Ralston, Richard E. "Publishing ''Anthem''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=24–27}}.</ref>

===''The Fountainhead'' and political activism===
{{see also|The Fountainhead|The Fountainhead (film)}}
During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican [[Wendell Willkie]]. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro-Willkie [[newsreels]].<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=57}}.</ref> This activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]] and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to Rand as "the most courageous man in America", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said "man" instead of "woman".<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=114}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=249}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=188–189}}.</ref> Rand also became friends with libertarian writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. Rand questioned Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, ''[[The God of the Machine]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=75–78}}.</ref>

Rand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=61–78}}.</ref> The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named [[Howard Roark]] and his struggle against what Rand described as "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=58–61}}.</ref> While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the [[amphetamine]] [[Benzedrine]] to fight fatigue.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=85}}.</ref> The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=89}}.</ref> Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=304–305}}.</ref>

''The Fountainhead'' became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=149}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=180–181}}</ref> In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] to [[Warner Bros.]] and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated ''[[Love Letters (1945 film)|Love Letters]]'' and ''[[You Came Along]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68–80}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=183–198}}.</ref> Rand also worked on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled "The Only Path to Tomorrow" in the January 1944 edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=171}}.</ref>

{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
Rand extended her involvement with free-market and [[anti-communist]] activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]], a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist [[American Writers Association]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=100–101, 123}}.</ref> A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=214–215}}.</ref> In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a "friendly witness" before the United States [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=91–93}}.</ref> Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|pp=188–189}}.</ref> She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=125}}.</ref> When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as "futile".<ref>{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=83}}.</ref>

After several delays, the film version of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she "disliked the movie from beginning to end", and complained about its editing, acting, and other elements.<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=71}}.</ref>

===''Atlas Shrugged'' and Objectivism===
{{see also|Atlas Shrugged|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist movement}}
[[File:Famous fantastic mysteries 195306.jpg|thumb|Rand's novella ''Anthem'' was reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]''.]]
In the years following the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated "The Collective") included future [[Federal Reserve Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]] and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. She later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged'', as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=256–264, 331–343}}.</ref>

''Atlas Shrugged'', published in 1957, was considered Rand's ''[[magnum opus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=113}}; {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005b|p=78}}.</ref> Rand described the theme of the novel as "the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest".<ref>Salmieri, Gregory. "''Atlas Shrugged'' on the Role of the Mind in Man's Existence". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2009|p=248}}.</ref> It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a [[welfare state]] government by going on [[Strike action|strike]] and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]], [[Romance novel|romance]], and [[science fiction]],<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=42}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|p=507}}.</ref> and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in the form of a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.<ref>Stolyarov II, G. "The Role and Essence of John Galt's Speech in Ayn Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged''". In {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|p=99}}.</ref>

Despite many negative reviews, ''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller. In an interview with [[Mike Wallace]], Rand declared herself "the most creative thinker alive".<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=2}}</ref> However, Rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=303–306}}.</ref> ''Atlas Shrugged'' was Rand's last completed work of fiction; it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.<ref name="ASturningpoint">{{harvnb|Gladstein|2000|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Younkins|2007|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=17}}.</ref>

In 1958, Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for [[Objectivist periodicals]] that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the [[Objectivist movement]] itself as a [[cult]] or religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=105–106}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=232–233}}.</ref> Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=236–237}}.</ref> However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}.</ref> Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=303}}.</ref> and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=237–238}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=329}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}.</ref>

===Later years===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=315–316}}</ref> [[Harvard]], and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=14}}.</ref> She received an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Humane Letters|Doctorate of Humane Letters]] from [[Lewis & Clark College]] on 2 October 1963.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=318}}.</ref> She also began delivering annual lectures at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], responding afterward to questions from the audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=16}}.</ref> During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day.

In 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott,<!-- Note: spelling is correct. --> whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,<ref>{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=101}}</ref> Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=344–358}}.</ref> Rand published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other "irrational behavior in his private life".<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=378–379}}.</ref> Branden later apologized in an interview to "every student of Objectivism" for "perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique" and for "contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement".<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=411}}.</ref> In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=386–389}}.</ref>

Rand underwent surgery for [[lung cancer]] in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=391–393}}.</ref> In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, she allowed Evva Pryor, an employee of her attorney, to enroll her in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].<ref>{{harvnb|McConnell|2010|pp=520–521}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Weiss|2012|p=62}}</ref> During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979.<ref>{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=392–395}}.</ref> One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=406}}.</ref>

Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City,<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=410}}.</ref> and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]].<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=405, 410}}.</ref> Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including [[Alan Greenspan]].

==Philosophy==
{{Objectivist movement}}
{{main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Rand called her philosophy "Objectivism", describing its essence as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–1171}}</ref> She considered Objectivism a [[systematic philosophy]] and laid out positions on [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political philosophy]], and [[aesthetics]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|p=224}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|Sciabarra|1999|p=2}}.</ref>

In metaphysics, Rand supported [[philosophical realism]], and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.<ref>Den Uyl, Douglas J. & Rasmussen, Douglas B. "Ayn Rand's Realism". In {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3–20}}.</ref>

In [[epistemology]], she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered [[axiom]]atic,<ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=54}}.</ref> and [[reason]], which she described as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses".<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}.</ref> She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge, including {{" '}}instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing{{' "}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=62–63}}.</ref> In her ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'', Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the [[analytic–synthetic dichotomy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005|p=1997}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=85–86}}.</ref>

In ethics, Rand argued for [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should "exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself".<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1989|p=3}}.</ref> She referred to egoism as "the virtue of selfishness" in her [[The Virtue of Selfishness|book of that title]],<ref name="Kukathas">{{harvnb|Kukathas|1998|p=55}}.</ref> in which she presented her solution to the [[is-ought problem]] by describing a [[meta-ethical]] theory that based morality in the needs of "man's survival ''qua'' man".<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2010}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=207, 219}}.</ref> She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness,<ref name="Badhwar 2010"/> and held that the [[initiation of force]] was evil and irrational, writing in ''Atlas Shrugged'' that "Force and mind are opposites."<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1023}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=313–320}}.</ref>

Rand's political philosophy emphasized [[individual rights]] (including [[Private property|property rights]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=350–352}}.</ref> and she considered ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.<ref name="rights"/> She opposed [[statism]], which she understood to include [[theocracy]], [[absolute monarchy]], [[Nazism]], [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[democratic socialism]], and [[dictatorship]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=369}}.</ref> Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.<ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=367}}.</ref> Although her political views are often classified as [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or [[libertarian]], she preferred the term "radical for capitalism". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=174–177, 209, 230–231}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=225–226}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=189–190}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=252}}.</ref> She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with [[anarchism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=266–267}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=268–269}}.</ref> She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in [[subjectivism]] that could only lead to collectivism in practice.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=371–372}}; {{harvnb|Merrill|1991|p=139}}.</ref>

In aesthetics, Rand defined art as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments". According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness.<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=204–205}}.</ref> As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered [[romanticism]] to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human [[free will]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=428}}.</ref> She described her own approach to literature as "[[romantic realism]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=207}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=437}}.</ref>

Rand acknowledged [[Aristotle]] as her greatest influence<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1171}}</ref> and remarked that in the [[history of philosophy]] she could only recommend "three A's"—Aristotle, [[Aquinas]], and Ayn Rand.<ref name="Sciabarra1995p12">{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=12}}.</ref> In a 1959 interview with [[Mike Wallace]], when asked where her philosophy came from she responded: "Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself."<ref>{{harvnb|Podritske|Schwartz|2009|pp=174–175}}.</ref> However, she also found early inspiration in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=16, 22}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=100–106}}.</ref> and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals,<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=24–25}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|pp=136, 138–139}}.</ref> in passages from the first edition of ''We the Living'' (which Rand later revised),<ref>{{harvnb|Merrill|1991|pp=38–39}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=135}}; Loiret-Prunet, Valerie.

Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her "theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force".<ref>{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=166}}.</ref> She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy,<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution]]|chapter=The Left: Old and New|page=62|isbn=0-452-01184-1|oclc=39281836|year=1999|location=New York|publisher=Meridian|last=Rand|first=Ayn|others=Edited by Peter Schwartz}}.</ref> stating: "I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of egoism, but of reason.

===Reviews===
During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, ''We the Living'', was admired by the literary critic [[H. L.

The first reviews Rand received were for ''Night of January 16th''. Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.<ref name="Branden 122-124"/> Rand believed that her first novel, ''We the Living'', was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work.<ref>Berliner, Michael S. "Reviews of ''We the Living''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2004|pp=147–151}}.</ref> Her 1938 novella ''Anthem'' received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.<ref>Berliner, Michael S. "Reviews of ''Anthem''". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005a|pp=55–60}}.</ref>

Rand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed.<ref name="tfreviews">Berliner, Michael S. "''The Fountainhead'' Reviews". In {{harvnb|Mayhew|2006|pp=77–82}}.</ref> There was a positive review in ''The New York Times'' that Rand greatly appreciated.<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=152}}.</ref> The reviewer called Rand "a writer of great power" who wrote "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that "you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time".<ref name="Pruette"/> There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications.<ref name="tfreviews"/> Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel,<ref name="Gladstein 117-119"/> such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style "offensively pedestrian".<ref name="tfreviews"/>

Rand's 1957 novel ''Atlas Shrugged'' was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative.<ref name="Gladstein 117-119"/><ref name="asreviews">Berliner, Michael S.

He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Soviets]]), claiming "From almost any page of ''Atlas Shrugged'', a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go!{{' "}}.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Chambers|first=Whittaker|authorlink=Whittaker Chambers|title=Big Sister is Watching You|magazine=[[National Review]]|pages=594–596|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222482/big-sister-watching-you/flashback|date=December 8, 1957|accessdate=April 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511214136/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222482/big-sister-watching-you/flashback|archivedate=May 11, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> ''Atlas Shrugged'' received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]],<ref name="asreviews"/> but Rand scholar [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] later wrote that "reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs", calling it "execrable claptrap" and "a nightmare"—they also said it was "written out of hate" and showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity".<ref name="Gladstein 117-119"/>

Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had.

She faced intense opposition from [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] and other contributors for the ''[[National Review]]'' magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by [[Whittaker Chambers]], [[Garry Wills]], and [[M. Stanton Evans]]. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other ''National Review'' contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2004}}.</ref>

The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party),<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2009|pp=54}}.</ref> despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being [[pro-choice]] and an atheist.<ref name="MJones">{{cite magazine|url=http://motherjones.com/media/2009/07/and-rand-played|title=And the Rand Played On|first=Amy|last=Benfer|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=July–August 2009|accessdate=April 15, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503215311/http://motherjones.com/media/2009/07/and-rand-played|archivedate=May 3, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> A 1987 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to her as the [[Reagan administration]]'s "novelist laureate".<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=279}}.</ref> Republican [[United States Congress|Congressmen]] and conservative [[pundits]] have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=124}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=xi}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2009|p=51}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=283}}.</ref>

===Academic reaction===
During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.<ref name="reception"/> When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand "a treacherous undertaking" that could lead to "guilt by association" for taking her seriously.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|1977|p=3}}.</ref> A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.<ref name="Gladstein115">{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=115}}.</ref> One of these was "On the Randian Argument" by libertarian philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], who argued that her [[meta-ethical]] argument is unsound and fails to solve the [[is–ought problem]] posed by [[David Hume]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the Randian Argument|last=Nozick|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Nozick|journal=[[The Personalist]]|date=Spring 1971|volume=52|pages=282–304}}</ref> Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in ''The Personalist'' arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case.<ref name="Gladstein115"/> Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2003|pp=373–374, 379–381}}</ref>

Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and [[Douglas B.

''Atlas Shrugged'' thus outsells Rand's non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of [[classical liberalism]] such as [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], or [[Frederic Bastiat]].<ref name="whyrand"/>

Political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only "philosophical debt" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1708/article_detail.asp|publisher=The Claremont Institute|title=Who is Ayn Rand?|first=Charles|last=Murray|year=2010|accessdate=December 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604055034/http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1708/article_detail.asp|archivedate=June 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H.

===Objectivist movement===
{{main|Objectivist movement}}
In 1985, Rand's intellectual heir Leonard Peikoff established the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, philosopher [[David Kelley]] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as [[The Atlas Society]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=280–281}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=19, 114}}.</ref> In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.<ref>{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=117}}.</ref> The charitable foundation of [[BB&T Corporation]] has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] are among the schools that have received grants.
